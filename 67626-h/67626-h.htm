</div>

<p>No one who has talked with many people
on the Eastern Question can have failed to
remark the wide difference of opinion held
on things which ought to be matters of certainty,
and on which two opinions ought to
be impossible. This divergence of view is
only a very natural consequence of the want
of any book of authority on the subject.
How is one to learn what manner of men
these Bulgarians and Greeks of Turkey really
are? Hitherto our information has been
chiefly obtained from newspaper correspondents:
and it is hardly necessary to observe
that the nature of their selected information
depends upon the tendency of the paper.
There have, of course, been notable exceptions
to this common rule of a party-conscience:
the world of journalists is but now
lamenting the untimely death of one of its
most distinguished members, with whose
name honor and truth and indefatigable
thoroughness must ever be associated. But
granting the honesty and impartiality of a
correspondent, allowing the accuracy of his
report of what he has seen, it must be conceded
that his opportunities for observation
are short and hurried, that he judges almost
solely from the immediate present, and that
by the nature of his profession he is seldom
able to make a very long or intimate study
of a people’s character. One accepts his reports
as the evidence of an eye-witness; but
one does not necessarily pledge one’s self to
his deductions. For the former task he has
every necessary qualification: for the latter
he may have none, and he probably has not
the most important. Especially unsafe is it
to trust to estimates of nations formed hastily
on insufficient experience in the midst of
general disorder, such as that in which many
summary verdicts have lately been composed.</p>

<p>But if newspaper correspondents are placed
at some disadvantage, what can be said for
those well-assured travellers who pay a three
months’ visit to Turkey, spend the time
pleasantly at Pera, or perhaps at the country-houses
of some Pashas, and then consider
themselves qualified to judge the merits of
each class in each nationality of the mixed
inhabitants of the land. It is unpleasant to
have to say it; but it is well known that
scarcely a single book upon Turkey is based
upon a much longer experience than of three
months.</p>

<p>In this dearth of trustworthy information,
it was with no little interest that I learnt that
an English lady, who had lived for a great
part or her life in various provinces of European
and Asiatic Turkey, and whose linguistic
powers perfected by experience enabled
her to converse equally with Greeks, Turks,
and Bulgarians as one of themselves, had
formed a collection of notes on the people of
Turkey—on their national characteristics,
the way they live, their manners and customs,
education, religion, their aims, and
ambitions. In any case the observations of
one who had for more than twenty years enjoyed
such exceptional advantages must be
valuable. Of the opportunities of the Author
there could be as little doubt as of her conscientious
accuracy in recording her experience.
The only question was not the quality
but the quantity of the information. But in
this the manuscript surpassed all expectations.
Every page teemed with details of
life and character entirely novel to all but
Eastern travellers. Every subject connected
with the people of Turkey seemed to be exhaustively
treated, and it was rarely that any
need for more ample information was felt.</p>

<p>In editing what, as I have had nothing to
do with the matter of it, I may without vanity
call the most valuable work on the people
of Turkey that has yet appeared, I have
strictly kept in view the principle laid down
by the Author—that the book was to be a
collection of facts, not a vehicle for party
views on the Eastern Question, nor a recipe
for the harmonious arrangement of South-eastern
Europe. Politically the book is entirely
colorless. It was felt that thus only
could it commend itself to both, or rather all,
the disputing parties on the question, and
that only by delicately avoiding the susceptible
points of each party could the book attain
its end—of generally imparting a certain
amount of sound information on the worst-known
subject of the day.</p>

<p>The reader, therefore, must not expect to
find here a defence of Turkish rule nor yet
an attack thereon: he will only find an account
of how the Turks do rule, with a few
incidental illustrations scattered throughout
the book. Comment is, as a rule, eschewed
as superfluous and insulting to the intelligence
of the reader. Still less must he look
for any expression of opinion on the wisdom
or folly of the policy of Her Majesty’s Government.
All these things are apart from
the aim of the work. It is wished to provide
the data necessary to the formation of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
worthy views on the many subdivisions of
the Eastern Question. It is not wished to
point the moral. Once conversant with the
actual state of the people of Turkey, once
knowing how they live, what are their virtues
and vices, what their aims and ambitions,
and it is easy for any rational man to draw
his conclusions; easy to criticise favorably
or otherwise according to the merits of the
case the policy of the British Government
towards Turkey and towards Greece, to decide
whether after all the supposed rising in
Bulgaria (about which little is said here, because
everything has already been well said)
was ever a rising at all; whether the Turks
are or are not incapable of the amenities
which many believe them then to have indulged
in; whether the Bulgarians are
friendly to Russia, or are really the very humble
servants of the Porte; in short, whether
half the questions which have for two years
been the subject of perpetual contention admit
of debate at all.</p>

<p>The book has been divided into four parts.
In the first, the general characteristics of the
various races of Turkey are sketched. Very
little is said about their history, for it is not
the history but the present state—or rather
the state just before the war—of the people
that is the subject of the book. But the
Author has tried to bring home to the reader
the social condition and the national character
of their different races. The Bulgarians,
Greeks, Albanians, Turks, Armenians, and
Jews are in turn described, and the, for the
time, scarcely less important Circassians,
with the Tatars and Gypsies, have their
chapter.</p>

<p>In the second part, the tenure of land in
Turkey and the state of the small peasant
farmers are explained, and an account is
given of houses and hovels in Turkey, including
that most superb of Turkish houses,
the Seraglio of the Sultan, to which with its
inmates a very detailed notice is devoted;
and the part ends with an account of Municipality
and Police in Turkey, together with
the kindred subject of Brigandage.</p>

<p>The third part is occupied with the manners
and customs of the races. Few things
give such an insight into the character of a
people as a study of their customs, and it is
believed that these chapters on the extraordinary
ceremonies employed in Turkey on the
occasion of a birth or marriage, or a death,
the dress, food, amusements, of the Greeks,
Bulgarians, Turks, and Armenians will prove
of as much value as interest. The fact, for
example, that in many parts of Bulgaria the
weddings take place not in the church but
in the cellar of the bridegroom’s house speaks
volumes on the insecurity of a woman’s person
while Turkish governors rule in Bulgarian
towns. The custom of the Bulgarian
bridegroom flinging a halter over his bride’s
neck and dragging her into his house is an
interesting relic of capture, and the subsequent
knocking of the bride’s head against
the wall as a warning against infidelity illustrates
the general chastity of the people. The
indecent exhibitions, again, at Turkish weddings
help to explain the want of refinement
and womanly feeling among Turkish ladies.
The ceremonies of the Greeks are interesting
from another point of view, inasmuch as very
many of them are identical with those of the
ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>The last part is devoted to the education,
superstition, and religion of the people of
Turkey. It is here that we get to the root of
Turkish manners; for we see how the Turk
is brought up, how he learns the vices that
have become identified with the thought of
his race, how he remains, in spite even of a
western education, deeply imbued with superstition,
and finally how he loses all the energy
of the old Othmanli character by the operation
of the fatal doctrine of Kismet. The
chapters on Education are among the most
valuable in the book; whilst those on Religion
will serve to explain some of the difficulties
that beset the proper adjustment of
affairs in Southern Europe.</p>

<p>The study of the facts thus brought together
points to a considerable modification of the
views commonly entertained with regard to
the characters of the peoples of Turkey. The
Author’s long experience leaves no doubt of
the vast superiority of the Greeks to the
other races; yet there is no people that one
is more accustomed to hear spoken of with
distrust and even contempt. The Greeks
are commonly charged with a partiality for
sharp practice, with intolerable vanity; their
character is summed up as petty. There is
always a grain of truth in a calumny:
when plenty of mud is thrown some of it
sticks, not because of the quantity of the mud,
but because there is sure to be an adhesive
sympathy with some part of the object of
the attack. The Greeks have in some degree
laid themselves open to these charges. It
was very unwise of them to take the first
rank as merchants in the East, and thus
arouse the jealousy of the merchants of all
European nations, whom they have eclipsed
by their superior business capacities. Envy
will pick holes anywhere, but it is especially
easy to criticise the customs of a merchant
class. Mercantile morality all over the world
is a thing of itself, not generally understanded
of the people. But there is nothing to show
that the Greek merchants are less scrupulous
than the rest, though their temptations are
infinitely greater. If a little sharp business
is said to be permissible, and even perhaps
necessary, at Liverpool, for instance, it is
<i>à fortiori</i> essential in Turkey. It is a perfectly
well-understood principle that in Turkey,
where everything is done by bribery
and corruption, a merchant, unless he wishes
to be ruined, must steer a somewhat oblique
course. So long as the late Turkish rule extended
over Greek subjects, it was necessary
to do in Turkey as the Turks do. French
and English merchants sin as much as the
Greeks in this manner; but the superior
commercial ability of the Greeks and their
consequent success have drawn on them the
whole evil repute. It is not that the Greeks
cheat more than other commercial nations:
it is merely that they make more money on
the same amount of cheating. <i>Hinc illæ iræ!</i></p>

<p>The Greeks, again, are certainly conceited,
and with excellent reason. It would be
absurd to expect anything else. They are
but newly freed; after centuries of Ottoman
tyranny, followed by a generation of Bavarian
despotism, they have at last been allowed
to enjoy some fifteen years of freedom. Even
under the stiff court of George, but much
more during the last fifteen years, they have
made prodigious progress. Having worked
out their own freedom, they have been making
themselves fit for freedom. From craven
slaves of the Turk they have become a liberty-loving
people. Their thoughts have
been casting back to the noble ancestry which
they claim as their own, and looking onward
to the great future that is in store for them.
They have measured themselves intellectually
with the rest of Europe and have not been
worsted. They have spent the last twenty
years in the work of self-education, and so
successful have been their efforts that it is
well known that no nation can compare with
Greece in the general education of its people—that
to Greece alone can be applied the
ambiguous taunt that she is over-educated.</p>

<p>All these things are legitimate subjects of
pride. It is no wonder that the Greeks are
vain of their adopted ancestors; no marvel
that they are proud of their keen wits and
facile intelligence. They have formed a justly
high estimate of their national worth, and
are justly proud of the progress they have
already made, and they take no pains to conceal
it. Their faults are only exaggerations
of national virtues, the outcome of the reaction
from a long servitude; they are the
necessary but temporary result of the circumstances.
A little time for development, a
closer association with the other powers of
Europe, and a worthier trust on the part of
these, and the Greeks will lose their blemishes
of youth; conceit will be toned down
to a proper pride, and high intelligence will
no longer be called over-cleverness. The nation
has marched steadily forward in the little
time it has been free; it has made great
steps in educating itself and in spreading
knowledge among its members still subject to
the alien; it has shown itself able to govern
itself, even to restrain itself under terrible
provocation when there was much to gain
and little that could be lost. If it is given
fair play, the time may yet come when a
seventh Great power shall arise in Europe,
when the Greeks shall again rule in Byzantium,
and Europe shall know that the name
of Hellenes is still a sacred name.</p>

<p>The Author’s account of the Bulgarians
differs little from the ordinary opinion, except
on one important point. She describes
them as honest hard-working peasants, rather
slow and stupid, but excellent laborers. But
she absolutely denies the ferocious character
ascribed to them by some writers. Every one
knows that they exacted a terrible vengeance
from the Turks, and no man of spirit can
blame them for it; though it is much to be
regretted that, if the accounts be true, they
carried their revenge to the length of Turkish
barbarity. But this was an exceptional time:
it has had its parallel in most nations, as
those who remember the feeling in England
at the time of the Indian mutiny can witness.
As a rule the Bulgarian is, on the contrary,
rather too tame. He is a very domestic
animal, lives happily with his family,
keeps generally sober, enjoys his dance on
the common on feast-days, and goes with
perfect willingness and satisfaction to his
daily work in the fields or at the rose-harvest.
He is an admirable agricultural laborer, with
a stolidity more than Teutonic, without the
Teuton’s energy. Yet these Bulgarians seem
to have a good deal of sound common sense,
and show many of the qualities necessary in
a people that is to govern itself. It has
hitherto submitted with curious tranquillity
to the Turkish yoke, and the Sultan has probably
had few less ill-affected servants than
the Bulgarians. On the other hand, it seems
that the Bulgarians entertain a very decided
hostility to Russia, an enmity second only to
their hatred for the Greeks.</p>

<p>The third important element in the future
of South-East Europe is the Turks. Of them
it is not necessary to say much: most
people are fairly enlightened as to the manners
and rule of the Turk, and the Author
has intentionally avoided crowding her pages
with Turkish atrocities: they are all very
much alike, and they are not pleasant reading.
The official classes meet with scant
respect at her hands; but with most writers
she speaks favorably of the Turkish peasant.
The principal vice he has is his religious
fanaticism, which is the result partly of
Mohammedanism itself, and partly of the
form and manner in which it is inculcated in
Turkey. Islam may be broad and tolerant
enough; but not the rigid orthodox Islam as
taught in the primary schools of the Ottoman
Empire. Islam is an excellent creed by
itself; but a ruling Mohammedan minority
in a Christian country is an endless source of
trouble. But the religious question is only
one of those which have disturbed the position
of the Porte. The system of administration,
as described in these pages, is enough to
overturn any power, and an official class
brought up under vicious home influences,
educated in fanatical mosque-schools, living
the self-indulgent indolent life of Stamboul,
getting and keeping office by bribery, administering
“justice” to the highest bidder,
is a doomed class. When one sees how a
Turkish child is brought up he begins to wonder
how any Turk can help being vicious and
dishonest. It is quite certain that there is no
hope for the Turks so long as Turkish women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
remain what they are, and home-training is
the initiation of vice. So far as can be
judged, the Turk naturally possessed some
of the true elements of greatness; but it is
rarely they come to bear fruit: they are
choked by the pernicious social system which
destroys the moral force of the women and
thereafter the men of the empire. It is this
carefully inculcated deficiency in all sense of
uprightness and justice, and this trained tendency
to everything that is a crime against the
community, that renders the Pasha incapable
of governing. It is this fact which compels
one to admit that, whatever the decisions of
the Berlin Congress, it is a clear gain that the
war has won for Europe, to be able to speak
of Turkish rule in the past tense.</p>

<p>With full knowledge of the experience and
research of the Author, I must yet say there
are some points—notably the Greek Church
of Russia—in which I cannot bring myself
to agree with her; and I must also add that,
owing to the haste with which the book was
put through the press, I have allowed a few
misprints to escape me.</p>

</div>

<p>The Bulgarians, who were completely
crushed by the Ottoman Conquest, and
whose very existence for centuries was
almost forgotten, have been suddenly brought
before the world by the late unhappy events
in their country.</p>

<p>Much has been written by English and
foreign authors respecting them, but few of
the writings on the subject appear to agree
with regard to the origin, the history, or the
present social and moral condition of this
much injured but deserving people. I have
no pretensions to throw a fresh light on the
first two points. The few remarks I shall
make are based upon such authors as are considered
most trustworthy, and especially on
the recent researches of Professor Hyrtl, reserving
to myself the task of describing the
moral and social condition of the modern
Bulgarians, as fourteen years spent among
them enables me to do.</p>

<p>From the Bulgarian Professor Drinov, who
appears to have made the Balkan peninsula
his especial study, we learn that before the
arrival of the Bulgarian tribes into European
Turkey, the southern side of the Danube
had been invaded by the Slavs, who during
four centuries poured into the country and,
steadily spreading, drove out the previous
inhabitants, who directed their steps towards
the sea-coasts and settled in the towns there.
In the beginning of the sixth century the
Slavonic element had become so powerful in
its newly-acquired dominions, and its depredatory
incursions into the Byzantine Empire
so extensive, that the Emperor Anastasius
found himself forced to build a wall from
Selymbria on the Sea of Marmora to Derkon
on the Black Sea in order to repel their attacks.
Procopius, commenting on this, relates
that while Justinian was winning useless
victories over the Persians, part of his
empire lay exposed to the ravages of the
Slavs, and that not less than 200,000 Byzantines
were annually killed or carried away
into slavery.</p>

<p>The hostile spirit, however, between these
two nations was broken by short intervals of
peace and friendly relations, during which
the Slav race supplied some emperors and
many distinguished men to the Byzantines.
Many Slavs resorted to Constantinople in
order to receive the education and training
their newly-founded kingdom did not afford
them. The migration of the Slavs into
Thrace ceased towards the middle of the seventh
century, when they settled down to a
more sedentary life, and, under the civilizing
influence of their Byzantine neighbors,
betook themselves to agricultural and pastoral
pursuits. According to historical accounts
the Slavs did not long enjoy their acquisitions
in peace, for about the year 679
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> a horde of Hunnish warriors, calling
themselves Bulgars (a name derived from
their former home on the Volga), crossed the
Danube under the leadership of their Khan,
Asparuch, and after some desperate fighting
with the Slavs, finally settled on the land now
known as Bulgaria and founded a kingdom
which in its turn lasted about seven hundred
years.</p>

<p>From the little that is known of the original
Bulgarians, we learn that polygamy was practised
among them, that the men shaved their
heads and wore a kind of turban, and the
women veiled their faces. These points of
similarity connect the primitive Bulgarians
with the Avars, with whom they came into
close contact, as well as with the Tatars, during
their long sojourn between the Volga and
Tanais, as witness the marked Tatar features
some of the Bulgarians bear to the present
day. The primitive Bulgarians are said to
have subsisted chiefly on the flesh of animals
killed in the chase; and it is further related
of them that they burnt their dead, and
when a chieftain died his wives and servants
were also burnt and their ashes buried with
those of their master. Schafarik, whose
learned and trustworthy researches on the
origin of the Bulgarians can scarcely be called
in question, remarks that the warlike hordes
from the Volga regions, though not numerous,
were very brave and well skilled in war.
They attacked with great ferocity the patient
plodding Slavs, who were engaged in cultivating
the land and rearing cattle, quickly
obtained the governing power, and after tasting
the comforts of a settled life, gradually
adopted to a great extent the manners, customs,
and even the language of the people
they had conquered. This amalgamation appears
to have been a slow process, occupying,
according to historical evidence, full two
hundred and fifty years. It is during this
period that the Bulgarian language must have
gradually been effaced, and the vanquishing
race, like the Normans in England, absorbed
by the vanquished.</p>

<p>This fresh mixture with the Slav element
constituted the Bulgarians a separate race,
with no original title to belong to the Slavonic
family beyond that derived from the fusion
of blood that followed the long intercourse
of centuries, by which the primitive Bulgarians
became blended with the former inhabitants
of the country. It is evident that they
were superior to the Slavs in military science
and power, but inferior as regards civilization,
and thus naturally yielded to the influence
of the more advanced and better organized
people. By this influence they created
a distinct nation, gave their name to the
country, and consolidated their power by
laws and institutions.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian kingdom, from its very
foundation in 679 until its final overthrow by
the Turks in 1396, presents a wearisome tale
of battles with short intervals of peace, in the
struggle for supremacy between the Emperors
of Byzantium and the rulers of Bulgaria.
The balance of power alternately inclined
from one party to the other; the wars were
inhuman on both sides; on the one hand, we
read of hundreds of thousands of Byzantines
yearly sacrificed by the Slavs; on the other,
we have equally horrible spectacles presented
to us, like that enacted during the reign of
Basil, surnamed Βουλγαροκτόνος (The Bulgarian-killer),
on account of the great number
of Bulgarians killed by his order. This savage,
having on one occasion captured a large
number of Bulgarians, separated 15,000 into
companies of 100 each, and ordered ninety-nine
out of each of these companies to be
blinded, allowing the remaining hundredth
to retain his sight in order to become the
leader of his blind brethren.</p>

<p>In the midst of such scenes, and at the cost
of torrents of blood, successive kingdoms
were constituted in this unhappy land of perpetual
warfare. Raised into momentary eminence
by the force of arms, they were again
hurled to the ground by the same merciless
instrument. Supreme power has been alternately
wielded by the savage, the Moslem,
and the Christian; each of whom to the
present day continues the work of destruction.</p>

<p>The condition of Bulgarians did not improve
under the Ottoman rule. Their empire soon
disappeared, leaving to posterity nothing but
a few ruined castles and fortresses, and some
annals and popular songs illustrating its past
glory. The Turkish conquest was more
deeply felt by the Bulgarians than by their
brethren in adversity, the Byzantines and the
neighboring Slav nations. These, owing to
the more favorable geographical position of
their countries and other advantages, were
able to save some privileges out of the general
wreck, and to retain a shadow of their national
rights. The Byzantines were protected
by a certain amount of influence left in
the hands of the clergy, while the Slav nations
were enabled to make certain conditions with
their conqueror before their complete surrender,
and were successful in enlisting the sympathies
and protection of friendly powers in
their behalf, and in obtaining through their
instrumentality at intervals reforms never
vouchsafed to the Bulgarians. This nation,
isolated, ignored, and shut out from the civilized
world, crouched under the despotic
rule of the Ottomans, and submitted to a life
of perpetual toil and hardship, uncheered by
any of the pleasures of life, unsupported by
the least gleam of hope for a better future.</p>

<p>This sad condition has lasted for centuries;
and by force of misery the people became
grouped into two classes: the poor,
who were constant to their faith and national
feeling, and the wealthy and prosperous, who
adopted Islam in order to escape persecution
and save their property. To this latter class
may be added the Pomaks, a predatory tribe
inhabiting a mountainous district between
the provinces of Philippopolis and Serres.
They live apart, and pass for Mussulmans
because they have some mosques; but they
have no knowledge of the Koran nor follow
its laws very closely. Most of them to this
day bear Christian names and speak the Slav
language. The men are a fine race, but
utterly ignorant and barbarous.</p>

<p>Upon the poor and therefore Christian class
fell all the weight of the Ottoman yoke,
which made itself felt in their moral and
material condition, and reached even to the
dress, which was enforced as a mark of servility.
They were forbidden to build
churches, and beyond the ordinary annual
poll-tax imposed by Moslems on infidel subjects,
they had to submit to the many illegal
extortions of rapacious governors and cruel
landlords; besides the terrible blood-tax
collected every five years to recruit the ranks
of the Janissaries from the finest children of
the province. Nor were the Bulgarian maidens
spared: if a girl struck the fancy of a Mohammedan
neighbor or a government official,
he always found means to possess himself of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
her person without using much ceremony or
fearing much commotion.</p>

<p>The depressing and demoralizing effect of
such a system upon the Bulgarians may be
imagined; it was sufficient to brutalize a
people far more advanced than they were at
the time of the conquest. It cowed them,
destroyed their brave and venturous spirit,
taught them to cringe, and weakened their
ideas of right and wrong. It is not strange
that a people thus demoralized should, under
the pressure of recent troubles, be said in
some instances to have acted treacherously
both towards their late rulers and present protectors;
but the vices of rapacity, treachery,
cruelty, and dishonesty could not have
been the natural characteristics of this unhappy
people until misery taught them the
lesson.</p>

<p>The laws promulgated in the reign of Sultan
Abdul-Medjid with respect to the amelioration
of the condition of the rayahs were
gradually introduced into Bulgaria, and their
beneficial influence tended greatly to remove
some of the most crying wrongs that had so
long oppressed the people. These reforms
apparently satisfied the Bulgarians—always
easily contented and peacefully disposed.
They were thankful for the slight protection
thus thrown over their life and property.
They welcomed the reforms with gratitude
as the signs of better days, and, stimulated
by written laws, as well as by the better system
of government that had succeeded the
old one and had deprived their Mohammedan
neighbors of some of their power of molesting
and injuring them, they redoubled their
activity and endeavored by industry to improve
their condition. Such changes can be
only gradual among an oppressed people in
the absence of good government and easy
communication with the outer world.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, inwardly, perhaps, still
dissatisfied, seemed outwardly content and
attached to the Porte in the midst of the revolutionary
movements that alternately convulsed
the Servian, Greek, and Albanian
populations. A very small section alone
yielded to the influence of the foreign agents
or <i>comitats</i>, who were using every means to
create a general rising in Bulgaria, or was at
any time in the Bulgarian troubles enticed to
raise its voice against the Ottoman Government
and throw off its allegiance. The late
movement is said to have received encouragement
from the Bulgarian clergy acting
under Russian influence, and from the young
schoolmasters, whose more advanced ideas
naturally led them to instil notions of independence
among the people. But these views were
by no means entertained by the more thoughtful
and important members of the community,
and no organized disaffection existed in Bulgaria
at the time the so-called revolt began. The
action of a few hot-headed patriots, followed
by some discontented peasants, started the revolt
which, if it had been judiciously dealt
with, might have been suppressed without
one drop of blood. The Bulgarians would
probably have continued plodding on as
faithful subjects of the Porte, instead of being
made—as will apparently be the case—a
portion of the Slav group. Whether this
fresh arrangement will succeed remains to be
seen; but according to my experience of
Bulgarian character, there is very little sympathy
between it and the Slav. The Bulgarians
have ever kept aloof from their Slavonic
neighbors, and will continue a separate
people even when possessed of independence.</p>

<p>The limits of Bulgaria, which must be drawn
from an ethnological standpoint, are not very
easily determined. The right of conquest and
long possession no doubt entitles the Bulgarians
to call their own the country extending
from the Danube to the Balkans. South of
that range and of Mount Scardos, however,
<i>i.e.</i>, in the northern part of Thrace and Macedonia,
their settlement was never permanent,
and their capital, originally established
in Lychnidos (the modern Ochrida), had to
be removed north of the Balkans to Tirnova.
The colonies they established were never
very important, since they were scattered in
the open country as better adapted to the agricultural
and pastoral pursuits of the nation.
These settlements, forming into large and
small villages, took Bulgarian names, but the
names of the towns remained Greek.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians south of the Balkans are a
mixed race, neither purely Greek nor purely
Bulgarian; but their manners and customs
and physical features identify them more
closely with the Greeks than with the Bulgarians
north of the Balkans. There the Finnish
type is clearly marked by the projecting
cheek-bones, the short upturned nose, the
small eyes, and thickly-set but rather small
build of the people.</p>

<p>In Thrace and Macedonia, where Hellenic
blood and features predominate, and Hellenic
influence is more strongly felt, the people
call themselves Thracians and Macedonians,
rather than Bulgarians; the Greek language,
in schools, churches, and in correspondence,
is used by the majority in preference
to the Bulgarian, and even in the late
church question in many places the people
showed themselves lukewarm about the separation,
and the bulk remained faithful to
the Church of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The sandjak of Philippopolis, esteemed
almost entirely Bulgarian by some writers, is
claimed for the Greeks by others upon the argument
that Stanimacho, with its fifteen villages,
is Greek with regard to language and
predilection, and Didymotichon, with its forty-five
villages, is a mixture of Greeks and
Bulgarians. As a matter of fact, however, in
this sandjak, in consequence of its proximity
to Bulgaria proper, and to its developed and
prosperous condition, the Bulgarian element
has taken the lead.</p>

<p>The revival of the church question and the
educational movement have stayed and almost
nullified Greek influence, which is limited
to certain localities like Stanimacho and
other places, where the people hold as
staunchly to their Greek nationality as the
Bulgarians of other localities do to their own.
While dispute waxed hot in the town of
Philippopolis between the parties of Greeks
and Bulgarians, each in defence of its rights,
no spirit of the kind was ever evinced in
Adrianople, where the population is principally
Greek and Turkish, with a small number
of Armenians and Bulgarians. In Macedonia
the sandjak of Salonika, comprising
Cassandra, Verria, and Serres, numbering in
all about 250.000 souls, is, with few exceptions,
Greek, or so far Hellenized as to be so to
all intents and purposes. The inhabitants of
Vodena and Janitza, and the majority in
Doïran and Stromnitza, and a considerable
portion of the population of Avrat Hissar, on
the right bank of the Vardar, claim Greek
nationality. The Greeks in this part of the
country have worked with the same tenacity
of purpose and consequent success in Hellenizing
the people, as the Bulgarians of the
kaza of Philippopolis in promoting the feeling
of Bulgarian nationality there. This
mission of the Greeks here has not been a
very difficult one, as the national feeling of
the bulk of the population is naturally
Greek.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the marked tendency of
the people towards Hellenism, the language
in Vodena and other places is Bulgarian;
but the features of the people, together with
their ideas, manners, and customs, are essentially
Greek; even the dress of the Bulgarian-speaking
peasant is marked by the absence
of the typical <i>potour</i> and the <i>gougla</i> or cap
worn in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Most of the authors who have written on
the populations of these regions have, either
through Panslavistic views or misled by the
prevalence of the Bulgarian language in the
rural districts, put down the whole of the
population as Bulgarian, a mistake easily
corrected by a summary of the number of
Greeks and Bulgarians conjointly occupying
those districts, separating the purely Greek
from the purely Bulgarian element, and taking
into consideration at the same time the
number of mixed Greeks and Bulgarians.</p>

<p>If the wide geographical limits projected
by Russia for Bulgaria be carried out, there
will be a recurrence of all the horrors of the
recent war in a strife between the Greeks
and Bulgarians, in consequence of the encroachment
of the future Bulgaria upon territory
justly laid claim to by the Greeks as
ethnologically their own and as a heritage
from past ages. The question would be
greatly simplified and the danger of future
contests between the two peoples much lessened,
if not entirely removed, by the Bulgarian
autonomy being limited to the country
north of the Balkans.</p>

<p>The Greek Government might not be equal
at first to the administration of their newly-acquired
kingdom, but if united in close alliance
with some friendly power and placed
under its tutelage, an honest and stable empire
might be established with every probability
of soon rising into a flourishing condition
in the hands of a people whose intelligence,
activity, and enterprising spirit give
them an incontestable superiority over the
other races of Turkey.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians south of the Balkans being,
as before said, of a mixed race engrafted upon
the Hellenic stock, would not be found to
offer any serious opposition. They are closely
incorporated with the Greek element in
some districts; while in others, where Bulgarian
feeling predominates, the people
would willingly migrate to Bulgaria proper,
as the Hellenized Bulgarians under such an
arrangement would draw nearer to Greece;
whilst in parts of Macedonia, where Hellenism
has the ascendancy, very little difficulty
would be met with from the Bulgarian settlements.</p>

<p>My recollections of Bulgarian social life
are to a great extent derived from a three
months’ stay I made under the hospitable
roof of a Bulgarian gentleman, or <i>Chorbadji</i>,
as he was called by his own people. He was
the most wealthy and influential person in
the town of T⸺, where his position as
member of the <i>Medjeiss</i> constituted him the
chief guardian and advocate of the Bulgarian
people of the district. I mention this in
order to show the reader that in his house
the opportunity of making important observations
and of witnessing national characteristics
were not wanting. These observations
embraced the social features I was allowed
to study in the midst of the home and family
life both of the educated and thinking Bulgarians
and of the peasants who daily flocked
to the house of my friend from the towns
and villages to submit to him their wrongs
and grievances, and, as their national representative,
to ask his advice and assistance before
proceeding to the local courts.</p>

<p>These levées began sometimes as early as
six o’clock in the morning, and lasted until
eleven. The <i>Kodja-bashi</i>, or headmen, would
come in a body to consult about the affairs
of the community, or to represent some
grave case pending before the local court of
their respective towns; or groups of peasants
of both sexes, sometimes representing
the population of a whole village, would arrive,
at the request of the authorities, to answer
some demand made by them, or plead
against an act of gross injury or injustice.
Whatever the cause that brought them daily
under my notice, the picture they presented
was extremely curious and interesting, and
the pleasure was completed by the privilege
I enjoyed of afterwards obtaining a detailed
account of the causes and grievances that
brought them there. When the interested
visitors happened to be elders of their little
communities or towns, they were shown into
the study of my host. After exchanging salutes
and shaking hands, they were offered
<i>slatko</i> (preserves) and coffee, and business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
was at once entered into. At such moments
the Bulgarian does not display the heat and
excitement that characterizes the Greek, nor
fall into the uproarious argument of the Armenians
and Jews, nor yet display the finessing
wit of the Turk; but steering a middle
course between these different modes of action,
he stands his ground and perseveres in
his argument, until he has either made his
case clear or is persuaded to take another
view of it. The subjects that most animated
the Bulgarians in these assemblies were
their national affairs and their dissensions
with the Greeks; the secondary ones were
the wrongs and grievances they suffered
from a bad administration; and although
they justly lamented these, and at times bitterly
complained of the neglect or incapacity
of the Porte to right them in an effective
manner and put a stop to acts of injustice
committed by their Mohammedan neighbors
and the local courts, I at no time noticed any
tendency to disloyalty or revolutionary notions,
or any disposition to court Russian
protection, from which, indeed, the most enlightened
and important portion of the nation
at that period made decided efforts to keep
aloof.</p>

<p>When it was the peasants who gathered at
the Chorbadji’s house, their band was led by its
Kodja-Bashi, who, acting as spokesman, first
entered the big gate, followed by a long train
of his brethren. Ranged in a line near the
porch, they awaited the coming of the master
to explain to him the cause of their visit.
Their distinguished-looking patron, pipe in
hand, shortly made his appearance at the
door, when caps were immediately doffed,
and the right hands were laid on the breast
and hidden by the shaggy heads bending
over them in a salaam, answered by a kindly
“Dobro deni” (good morning), followed by
the demand “Shto sakaty?” (what do you
want?) The peasants, with an embarrassed
air, looked at each other, while the Kodja-Bashi
proceeded to explain matters. Should
his eloquence fall short of the task, one or
two others would step out of the ranks and
become spokesmen. It was almost painful
to see these simple people endeavoring to
give a clear and comprehensive account of
their case, and trying to understand the advice
and directions of the Chorbadji. A
half-frightened, surprised look, importing
fear or doubt, a shrug of the shoulders, accompanied
by the words “Né znam—Né
mozhem” (I do not know, I cannot do), was
generally the first expression in answer to the
eloquence of my friend, who in his repeated
efforts to explain matters frequently lost all
patience, and would end by exclaiming, “Né
biddy magari!” (Don’t be donkeys!)—a remark
which had no effect upon the band of
rustics further than to send them off, full of
gratitude, to do as he had counselled.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may be curious to know
the details of some of the cases daily brought
under my notice. I will mention a few not
connected with Turkish oppression and maladministration;
for by this time the English
public has been pretty well enlightened on
that subject. My list will include some
rather more original incidents which took
place in the community: disputes between
all non-Mussulmans are generally settled by
the temporal or spiritual chiefs, and seldom
brought before the Courts of Justice.</p>

<p>While Greeks and Bulgarians in the heat
of controversy were snatching churches and
monasteries from each other, the priests and
monks who were attached to these sacred
foundations found themselves unpleasantly
jostled between the two hostile elements. To
be a Greek priest or monk and be forced to
acknowledge the supremacy of an anathematized
and illegal church was a profanation
not to be endured; and, on the other hand,
to be a Bulgarian and be forced to pray day
by day for a detested spiritual head rejected
by his nation was an insupportable anomaly.
In the midst of the difficulty and confusion
at first caused by this state of affairs, some
of the good fathers and monks had to remove
their quarters and betake themselves
to a wandering life, visiting their respective
communities and encouraging the people by
their exhortations to hold fast to their church
and oppose with all their might the claims
and usurping tendencies of the others.
Among these a Bulgarian monk, more venturous
and evidently endowed with a greater
amount of imaginative eloquence than the
rest, and rejoicing in the title of Spheti Panteleemon,
regarded himself as the prophet of
the Bulgarian people. This Saint Panteleemon
was a man of middle age and middle
height, with a jovial face, a cunning look,
and an intelligent but restless eye, by no
means indicative of an ascetic view of life.</p>

<p>Contrary to the saying that no man is a
prophet in his own country, Spheti Panteleemon
was acknowledged as such by a considerable
class of his people, consisting entirely
of the gentle sex, and his success among them
was as great as ritualism appears to be in
England.</p>

<p>The preaching of this prophet, intended
solely for the Bulgarian women, became so
pronounced in its tenets, so eloquent in its
delivery, and was rendered so impressive by
the different means he employed to instil his
precepts into the hearts and minds of his
hearers, that their number soon increased
into a vast congregation, which flocked from
all parts of the country to hear the words of
their favorite saint. On such occasions,
this false prophet, who had managed to
usurp possession of a small monastery, would
stand forth amid thousands of women, who
at his approach would cross themselves and
fall down almost to worship him. Spheti
Panteleemon, in acknowledgment of this
mark of devotion, would raise his voice and
rehearse his doctrines to the devotees. These
doctrines included strange principles, asserted
by their author to be the best and surest
way to Paradise; but they scarcely conduced
to the satisfaction of the husbands. Women,
according to this man, were to be free and
independent, and their principal affections
were to be bestowed upon their spiritual
guide; their earnestness was to be proved by
depositing their earthly wealth (consisting
chiefly of their silver ornaments) at his feet.
The practical Bulgarian husbands, however,
were by no means admirers of this new spiritual
director, whose sole object appeared to
be to rob them of the affections of their wives
along with their wealth, and they soon raised
their voices against his proceedings. After
holding counsel on the subject, they decided
to give notice of his doings to the local authorities,
and by their influence to have him
sent out of the country. The prophet was
arrested one fine morning, while addressing
a congregation of 500 women, by a body of
police, and brought to the prison of the town
of S⸺, whilst all the women devoutly followed,
weeping, beating their breasts, and
clamoring for the release of their saint. The
husbands, on the other hand, pleaded their
grievances against this disorganizer of society,
and proved his dishonesty by displaying
to the authorities a quantity of silver trinkets
of all descriptions taken from his dwelling,
to the great indignation of his devotees.
The imagination of some of these ignorant
and superstitious peasant women had been
so worked upon that they solemnly declared
to me that the feet of their prophet never
touched the ground, but remained always
a distance of two feet above it, and that his
sole sustenance was grass. While his fate
was still undecided, amidst the wailings of
the women, the protests of the husbands,
and the embarrassment of the authorities, the
fellow got out of the difficulty by declaring
himself a “Uniate” and a member of the
Church of Rome. This avowal could not
fail to excite the interest of the agents of
that body: they claimed the stray sheep as
redeemed, took him under their immediate
protection, but (it is to be hoped) deprived
him of his pretended attribute of sanctity and
the power of making himself any longer a
central object of attraction to the <i>beau sexe</i>.</p>

<p>Another incident was of a nature less sensational
but equally repulsive to the feelings
and notions of the strict portion of the Bulgarian
nation, and had also a monk for its
hero. It consisted of an elopement, and if
there is one crime that shocks and horrifies
orthodox people more than another, it is that
of a monk who, taking the vows of celibacy,
perjures himself by adopting the respectable
life of a married man. Such events are of
very rare occurrence, and when they take
place cause a great commotion.</p>

<p>This monk, at the time of the disputed
church rights, lost his solitary retreat, and
was once more thrown in contact with the
world he had forsworn. Sent adrift, he set
out in search of an unknown destiny, without
hope or friends, uncertain where his next
meal was to come from. After a long day’s
march, he lay down to rest under a tree in a
cultivated field, and, overcome by fatigue,
fell asleep. He was about twenty-five years
of age, tall, with regular features, a startlingly
pale complexion, and coal black eyes,
hair, and beard; his whole appearance, indeed,
rather handsome than otherwise. Such,
at least, was the description given of him by
the rustic beauty who surprised him while
driving her father’s cattle home.</p>

<p>A Bulgarian monk in those stirring times
was always an object of interest, even to a
less imaginative person than a young maiden.
She, therefore, considered it her duty
to watch over his slumbers, and refresh him
with bread and salt on awaking. Quietly
seating herself by his side, she awaited the
arousal of the unconscious sleeper. When
he awoke, his eyes met those of the girl, and
in that exchange of looks a new light dawned
upon these two beings, who, though they
had never met before, were now to become
dearer to each other than life itself. The
monk forgot his vows and poured forth his
tale of love to a willing listener, who immediately
vowed to follow his fortunes and become
his wife, or end her days in a convent.
This illustrates the definition of love once
given to me by a Bulgarian gentleman:
“Chez nous l’amour n’a point de préliminaires;
on va droit au fait.” The adventurous
couple forthwith eloped, and wandered
about the country, until the monk was discovered,
in spite of his disguise, by the scandalized
Bulgarians, by whom he was once
more sent to a monastery, imprisoned in a
dungeon, condemned to live upon dry bread
and to undergo daily corporal chastisement
for his sins. But the adventurous
maiden, determined to effect his release, contrived
to make friends with the Kir Agassi,
or head of the mounted police in the district
where the monastery was situated, and
through his instrumentality the monk was
again set at liberty. The subject was discussed
in all its bearings at the house of my
friends, until the couple wisely adopted Protestantism,
and after being married by a minister
of that church settled down to a peaceful
life of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>A third incident illustrates the Bulgarian
appreciation of surgical art. The name of
surgeon was unknown in the country villages,
and that of dentist, even in a large
town like S⸺, until an adventurous spirit
belonging to the latter profession, in the
course of a speculative tour, established himself
there. The inhabitants, on passing his
house, used to stop and gaze in wonder at
the sets of teeth displayed under glass cases.
Conjecture ran wild as to how these were
made and could be used. Some imagined
them to be abstracted front the jaws of dead
persons, salted, and prepared in some mysterious
way for refitting in the mouths of the
living.</p>

<p>The fame of the dentist’s art began to be
noised abroad throughout the district, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
many became desirous, if not of procuring
new teeth, at least of having some troublesome
old stumps extracted. Among these
was a well-to-do Bulgarian peasant, who
presented himself in the surgery for this purpose.
The dentist relieved him of his tooth
with great facility, to the man’s exceeding
astonishment. On leaving he took out his
long knitted money-bag, carefully counted
out five piastres (10<i>d.</i>), and handed them to
the dentist, who returned them, saying that
his fee would be half a lira. “What!” exclaimed
the indignant Bulgarian; “do you
mean to say that you will charge me so
much, when last week I underwent the same
operation at the hands of my barber, and
after a struggle of two hours over an obstinate
tooth, during which I had several times
to lie flat on my back and he and I were both
bathed in perspiration until it finally yielded,
I paid him five piastres, with which he was
quite contented; and you, who were only a
few minutes over it, demand ten times that
sum! It is simply monstrous, and I shall
forthwith lodge a complaint against you!”</p>

<p>As good as his word, in a fever of excitement
he arrived at the Chorbadji’s house to
denounce the extortionate Frank. When
quietly asked if it were not worth while to
pay a larger sum and get rid of his tooth
without loss of time and trouble, instead of
spending two hours of suffering and violent
exertion for which he was charged only five
piastres, he admitted that such was the case,
and that the Frank was a far cleverer man
than the barber could ever hope to be.</p>

<p>Social life among the Bulgarians differs
little from that of the Greeks, save in the
greater ascendancy the Bulgarian wives of
the working classes have over their husbands.
This advantage is probably derived
from the masculine manner in which they
share in the hardy toil, working by the side
of their husbands, and by their personal exertions
gaining almost as much as the men do.
The care of clothing the family also devolves
entirely upon them, besides which they
have to attend to their domestic duties, which
are always performed with care, cleanliness,
and activity. Simple as these tasks may be,
they require time, which the housewife always
manages to find. The well-beaten
earthen floor is always neatly swept, the
rugs and bedding carefully brushed and
folded up, and the copper cooking utensils
well scoured and ranged in their places. The
cookery is simple but very palatable, especially
the pastry, which is excellent; whilst
the treacle and other provisions stored away
for the winter are wholesome and good.</p>

<p>Some uninformed authors have, I believe,
stated that not only are the Bulgarian men
seldom to be seen in a state of sobriety, but
that the women also indulge to a great extent
in the vice of drunkenness. So far as I
am able to judge, this statement is utterly
groundless; for no woman in the east, whatever
her nationality, disgraces herself by
drinking to excess in the shops where spirituous
drinks are sold, or is ever seen in the
streets in a state of intoxication. The man
certainly likes his glass, and on occasions
freely indulges in it; but excesses are committed
only on feast-days, when the whole
village is given up to joviality and merriment.</p>

<p>The townspeople seldom indulge in these
festivities; but tied down to a sedentary
life, cheered by no view of the open country,
nor by fresh air and the rural pursuits congenial
to their nature, they lead a monotonous
existence, divided between their homes
and their calling. The women on their side
fare no better, and with the exception of paying
and receiving calls on feast-days, or taking
a promenade, keep much within doors,
occupying themselves with needlework and
taking an active part in their domestic affairs.
This quiet uniform life is occasionally brightened
by an evening party, or even a ball, if
the deficiency in the arrangement of the
rooms, the refreshments, and especially the
<i>sans gêne</i> observed with regard to dress, permit
of the name. One of these festive scenes
was illuminated by large home-made tallow
candles, supported by candelabra of Viennese
manufacture, further supplemented by another
innovation in the shape of a pair of elegant
snuffers, which fortunately obviated the
usual performance with the fingers, by which
the ball-rooms are usually perfumed with the
odor of burnt mutton chops. Setting aside
minor details, my attention was much attracted
by the queer versatility of the band,
which suddenly changed from the national
<i>hora</i> to an old-fashioned polka which had
just been introduced as a great novelty, but
was indulged in only by married couples, or
timid brothers and sisters, who held each
other at so respectful a distance that another
couple might easily have passed between
them. But the greatest charm of the gathering
was the <i>coup d’œil</i> that embraced dress,
deportment, and decorations. The dress was
as varied in shape and material as the forms
of the wearers. Double and triple fur coats,
according to age and taste, safely sheltered
the majority of the gentlemen from cold and
draughts; well-fitting frock coats distinguished
the few <i>comme il faut</i> officials; while
dress coats of Parisian cut distinguished the
quiet and apparently gentlemanlike youths
brought up in Europe, and contrasted with
the less elegant toilettes of their untravelled
brethren dressed <i>à la Bulgare</i>.</p>

<p>The variety in the dress of the ladies was
equally diverting. Some wore their fur
jackets over rich silk dresses, others, more
fashionable, dispensed with the weight of this
unnecessary article; while the heads of all of
them sparkled with jewelry. Crinoline, often
heard of under the name of “Malakoff,”
but unseen in the town before 1855, was supposed
to be introduced into the room by a
German Jewish lady, an old resident in the
town, and was so proudly displayed by her
in all its proportions, that it attracted the attention
of a homely old Bulgarian <i>gospoyer</i>,
who, in a simple manner, quietly turned up
the hem of her dress and displayed to a small
section of the astonished assembly an ingenious
substitute for the crinoline made of <i>The
Times</i> newspaper!</p>

<p>The chapter on Peasant-holdings treats at
some length of the Bulgarian peasant, of his
capacity for work, and the amount of ease
and prosperity he is able to attain in spite of
the many drawbacks that surround him.
His prosperity is due to two sources—the
modesty of his wants, and the activity of his
whole family. The fruits of such a system
are naturally good when the soil, climate, and
other natural advantages favor it.</p>

<p>But some parts of Bulgaria are far from
being the Utopia some newspaper correspondents
have represented it, with vines
hanging over every cottage-door, and milk
and honey flowing in the land. Nothing but
long residence and personal experience can
enable one to arrive at a true estimate of such
matters.</p>

<p>Though in some parts I found the scenery
delightful, the prosperity of the inhabitants
astonishing, and Moslems and Christians
rivalling each other in hospitable kindness to
the traveller, some spots were anything but
romantic or prosperous, and far from happy-looking.
Some villages, in particular, I noticed
in the midst of a dreary plain, such as
the traveller may see on the road from Rodosto
to Adrianople, where the soil looks dry
and barren, and the pastures grow yellow
and parched before their time, and where flying
bands of Circassian thieves and cut-throats
hover about like birds of prey. I
was once travelling through the country, riding
the whole of one day on such bad roads
that the mud often reached up to my horse’s
knees, and the carriage containing my maid
and the provisions often came to a dead stop,
while the rain poured incessantly. The
journey appeared interminable, and as darkness
crept on and several miles of road still
separated us from our projected halting-place,
I made up my mind to stop at an isolated
village for the night. So traversing
fresh pools of mud we entered the hamlet,
and were met by the Kodja-Bashi, a poorly-clad,
miserable-looking individual, who led
our party into his farm-yard. On alighting
from my horse I was ushered into a dark,
bare, dismal hovel, without windows, and
lighted only by a hole in the roof, through
which escaped some of the smoke from a
few dung-cakes smouldering in a corner.
One or two water-jars stood near the door,
and an earthen pot, serving for all culinary
purposes, was placed by the fire, in front of
which was spread a tattered mat occupied by
a few three-legged stools. A bundle of uninviting
rags and cushions, the family bedding,
was stowed in a corner, and in another
were seen a few pots and pans, the whole
“table service” of the occupants.</p>

<p>This hovel was attached to a similar one
opening into it, where I heard some bustle
going on. I was told that a member of the
family who occupied it and was seriously ill
was being removed to a neighbor’s house.
Much annoyed at having caused so much
trouble and disturbance to the unfortunate
sufferer, I asked my host why he had not
placed me in another cottage. “Well, <i>gospoyer</i>,”
answered he, with an apologetic
gesture, “poor and wretched as my home is,
it is the best the village possesses. The rest
are not fit to kennel your dogs in. As for
my daughter, I could not but remove her, as
her cries during the night would prevent
your sleeping.” I inquired her complaint,
and was told that she was in high fever, and
suffered from sharp pains all over her body.
There was no doctor to attend her, nor had
she any medicine but the decoctions prepared
for her by the old <i>bulkas</i>.</p>

<p>I visited the poor creature and gave what
help I could; but, being by no means reassured
as to the nature of her malady, and unwilling
to sleep in the vicinity of an infected
room, I ordered the carriage to be placed under
a shed and proposed to pass the night in
it. The host, however, on hearing this, told
me that it was quite impracticable, as the
village dogs were so famished that they
would be sure to attack the carriage for the
sake of the leather on it. “I have taken the
precaution,” he added, “of removing every
part that is liable to be destroyed, but there
is no telling what these animals will do.” I
then ordered the hamper to be brought in
and supper to be prepared; but on sitting
down on the floor to partake of it we discovered
that our provision of bread was exhausted,
and learnt that not a morsel was procurable
in the village. Our host explained this
by saying, “You see, <i>gospoyer</i>, our village is
so poor and miserable that we have no drinkable
water, and our <i>bulkas</i> have to fetch it
from a distance of three miles. We have no
fuel either, for the village has no forest, and
we content ourselves with what you see on
the hearth. As for bread, it is a luxury we
seldom enjoy; millet flour mixed with water
into a paste and baked on the ashes is
our substitute for it; it does for us, but
would not please you.”</p>

<p>In the mean time the women and children
had gathered round me in the little room,
all looking so poor, fever-stricken, and miserable,
and casting such looks of eager surprise
at the exhibition of eatables before me,
that I felt positively sick at heart; all my
appetite left me, and distributing my supper
among the hungry crowd, I contented myself
with a cup of tea, and endeavored to forget
in sleep the picture of misery I had witnessed.
I was thankful to get away in the
morning, and am happy to say that neither
before nor since have I witnessed such poverty
and misery as I saw in that village.</p>

<p>The marked slowness of perception in the
character of the Bulgarian peasants, and
their willingness to allow others to think and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
act for them in great matters, is not so apparent
when the immediate interests of the
village or community are concerned. Before
referring these to the higher authorities,
they meet and quietly discuss their affairs,
and often settle the differences among themselves.
The respect the Bulgarian entertains
for the clergy and for the enlightened portion
of his fellow-countrymen is so great that
he allows himself to be entirely guided by
them, evincing in small things as well as
great the feeling of harmony and union that
binds the whole people together. But the
reverse of this disposition is manifested by
the Bulgarians, more especially the peasants,
towards any foreign element, and particularly
towards the Turkish authorities. Obedient
and submissive as they have generally shown
themselves under the Ottoman rule, they
have inwardly always disliked and distrusted
it, saying that the government with regard
to their country, its richest field of harvest,
has only one object in view—that of
getting as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>This prevalent idea, not altogether ill-founded,
gave to the Bulgarian character
that rapacity and love of gain which, being
developed by late events, in the midst of general
ruin and loss of property, tempted him
to try to get what he could of what had been
left, without much scruple as to the means.
When unmerited calamities befall a people,
and oppression long weighs heavily upon
them, the sense of justice and humanity is
gradually lost and replaced by a spirit of
vindictiveness which incites to ignoble and
cruel actions. This ought not to surprise the
world in the case of the Bulgarians, when
their national life during the last two years is
taken into consideration; for what is it but a
series of unspeakable outrages by their enemies,
and destruction by those who professed
themselves their friends?</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, however, as I have known
them in more peaceful times, never appeared
to possess as national characteristics the vices
that hasty and partial judges arguing from
special instances have attributed to them.
On the contrary, they seemed a peace-loving,
hard-working people, possessing many domestic
virtues which, if properly developed
under a good government, might make the
strength of an honest and promising state.</p>

</div>

<p>All eyes are now turned upon the Greek
race as one of the most important factors in
the Eastern Question. The future of South-Eastern
Europe is seen to lie in the balance
between Greek and Slav, and people’s opinions
incline to one side or the other as dread
of Russia or distrust of “Greek guile” gets
the upper hand. I have nothing to say here
about the people of free Hellas: I have only
to tell what I have witnessed of the character
and condition of the subject Greeks in
Turkey. These, though they shared in the
national effort of 1821-9, reaped little of the
fruits. The Greeks of Macedonia, Thessaly,
and Thrace did not gain the freedom accorded
to the people of “Greece Proper,” though
their condition was somewhat improved.
But they are only biding their time. They
know that their free countrymen are anxious
to share with them the results of the glorious
struggle of 1821. They know that centuries
of subjection and oppression have demoralized
and debased the nation; and they have
long been striving with their whole strength
to prepare themselves for freedom. They
have employed the time of transition with
great moderation and judgment. Those
whom the Porte has appointed to high offices
have filled their posts with conscientiousness,
fidelity, and dignity. Taught worldly
wisdom in the school of adversity, they have
avoided premature conspiracy and rebellion,
and have directed all their energies to educating
the race for its future. “Improve and
wait patiently” is the motto of the Greeks in
Turkey.</p>

<p>The Greek peasant differs greatly from the
Bulgarian. Agriculture is not all the world
to him; his love for the pursuit is decidedly
moderate unless he sees an opening for enterprise
and speculation, as in the growth of
some special kind of produce which he can
sell in the raw condition or as manufactured
goods. Unlike the Bulgarian, his whole
family is not chained to the soil as the one
business of life. When the paterfamilias can
dispense with the services of some of his
daughters, they leave their home in pursuit
of occupation, and his sons in the same manner
are allowed to quit the paternal roof in
search of some more lucrative employment
elsewhere. It is thus that the Greek is to be
found in every nook and corner of Turkey,
established among his own kindred or with
foreigners, and following various professions
and callings, as doctors, lawyers, schoolmasters;
whilst, descending to a lower scale, we
find him employed in every town and village
as a petty tradesman, mason, carpenter, shoe-maker,
musician, in all which occupations he
manages by dint of energy, perseverance, and
address to obtain a modest competence, or
sometimes even to reach prosperity.</p>

<p>I remember, among other instances of the
kind, the case of a Greek peasant family in
the district of B⸺. The father was a respectable
man, who owned a small property
in his native village, and whose quiver was
filled with eight children. The eldest remained
to assist on the farm; two others of
tender age also remained under the mother’s
care; the other five, including a girl, left
their home, and came to the town. One of
the boys and the girl took service with me;
a second boy apprenticed himself to a photographer,
another became a painter of
church pictures, and the fourth a cigarette-maker.
The salaries these young peasants
received were at first very meagre; but all
the same the four boys clubbed their savings
together, and after a time sent for their
younger brother to live in town in order to
enjoy the benefit of receiving a good education.
Six years passed, during which the
boy and his pretty and intelligent sister remained
in my house; both learned to speak
English, the boy having studied the language
grammatically in his leisure moments. They
are now honest, intelligent servants, perfect
in the performance of their duties, and devoted
to my family. The three apprentices,
through their steadiness, good conduct, and
energy, have become proficient enough in
their different callings to set up for themselves,
while the boy at school is one of the
most advanced students of the <i>Gymnasium</i>.</p>

<p>The intellectual position of the Greeks is
far superior to that of the Bulgarians. They
are cleverer, and they and their children are
more advanced in education. They display
a great interest in passing events, as well as
in politics, a knowledge of which they obtain
by means of the numerous Greek newspapers
they receive from Athens, Constantinople,
and all the large towns of Turkey. These
journals find their way to the remotest hamlets,
one or two being sufficient to make the
round of a village. They also possess other
literature in the shape of the history of their
country, biographies of some of their illustrious
ancestors, and national songs in the
vernacular. All these make a deep impression
upon the entire population, who, after
the conclusion of the labors of the day, gather
together in the taverns and coffee-houses to
discuss matters, talking excellent sense over
the coffee-cup, or waxing hot and uproarious
over their wine and <i>raki</i>.</p>

<p>The Greek peasant displays none of the
embarrassment and tonguetiedness of the
Bulgarian. I have often met with instances
of this: one especially struck me which happened
in the early part of last summer in the
vilayet of B⸺. Some Bashi-bazouks had
entered a village, and committed some of
their usual excesses; but the peasants had
found time to send away their wives and
daughters to a place of safety. On the following
day a body of fifty Greeks came to
complain to the authorities. In order to
render their claims more effective, they applied
for protection at the different Consulates.
I happened to be at luncheon at one
of these Consulates, and the Consul ordered
the men to be shown into the dining-room to
make their statements. One at once stepped
forward to give an account of the affair,
which he related with so much eloquence
and in such pure modern Greek that the
Consul, suspecting him to be some lawyer in
disguise, or a special advocate of Greek
grievances, set him aside, and called upon
another to give his version. Several looked
questioningly at each other, but with no sign
of embarrassment; on the contrary, the expression
on each face betokened natural self-confidence,
and meant in this instance to say,
“We can each tell the tale equally well, but
I had better begin than you.”</p>

<p>Patriotism is highly developed among the
Greek peasants, who are fully aware of the
meaning of the word <i>patris</i>, and taught to
bear in mind that half a century ago free
Hellas formed part of the Ottoman Empire;
that its inhabitants, like themselves, were a
subject people, and owe the freedom they
now enjoy to self-sacrifice and individual
exertion. “They are our elder brothers,”
say they, “who have stepped into their inheritance
before us. There is a just God for
us as well!”</p>

<p>The wants of the Greek are more numerous
than those of the Bulgarians. Their
dress, for instance, is not limited to a coarse
suit of <i>aba</i> and a sheepskin <i>gougla</i>, but is
sometimes made of fine cloth and other rich
materials, and includes shoes and stockings.
The culinary department also demands more
utensils; besides which, tables, table-linen,
knives and forks are often seen at their
meals. The bedding they use is more complete,
and does not consist solely of rugs, as
with the Bulgarians. Their houses are better
built, with some regard to comfort and
appearance, frequently with two stories, besides
possessing chimneys and windows
(when safe to do so). The village schools
are better organized, and kept under the
careful supervision of the Society for their
direction, and the churches are more numerous.
The women are less employed in field
work, and consequently more refined in their
tastes, prettier in appearance, and more careful
and elegant in their dress. The Greek
peasant girl knows the value of her personal
charms, and disdains to load herself with the
tarnished trinkets, gaudy flowers, and other
wonderful productions in which the Bulgarian
maiden delights. A skirt of some bright-colored
silk or mixed stuff and a cloth jacket
embroidered with gold form the principal
part of her gala costume, covered with a
fur-lined pelisse for out-of-door wear. Her
well-combed hair is plaited in numerous
tresses, and surmounted by the small Greek
cap, which is decorated with gold and silver
coins like those she wears as a necklace.
She is not to be bought, like the Bulgarian,
for a sum of money paid to her father as an
equivalent for her services; but according to
her means is dowered and given in marriage,
like the maidens of classical times. Still the
peasant girl is neither lazy nor useless; she
takes an active part in the duties of the
household, is early taught to knit and spin
the silk, flax, wool, or cotton which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
mother requires for the different home-made
tissues of the family. She leads her father’s
flock to the pasture, and under the title of
<i>Voskopoula</i> kindles a flame in the heart of the
village youth and inspires the rustic muse.
On Sundays and feast-days she enters heartily
into all the innocent pleasures of her retired
and isolated life. She has more pride than
the Bulgarian; and although in married life
she is submissive and docile, she possesses a
greater depth and richness of love. I have
known instances of peasant girls exchanging
vows with youths of their village who are
leaving their home in search of fortune, and
patiently waiting for them and refusing all
offers in the mean time. In most cases this
devotion is requited by equal constancy on
the part of the lover; but should she be deserted,
her grief is so terrible that she not
seldom dies from the blow.</p>

<p>If there is more than one daughter in a
family, some from the age of twelve or fourteen
are usually sent to town and placed out
as servants, with the double object of giving
them the opportunity of seeing more of the
world and the means of earning something
for their own maintenance. These earnings
as they are acquired are converted into gold
coins and strung into necklaces.</p>

<p>When these girls are honest and good,
and fall into proper hands, they are usually
adopted by the family with whom they take
service, under the title of ψυχόπαιδα. On
reaching the age of twenty-five or twenty-seven
a trousseau is given to them with a
small dowry, and they are married to some
respectable artisan. Those simply hired as
servants either marry in the towns or do so
on returning to their native village.</p>

<p>The Greek peasant women are as a rule
clean and industrious, fond mothers and virtuous
wives. The best proof of their morality
is in the long absences many husbands are
obliged to make from their homes, which are
attended by no unfaithful results. In some
instances for a period of even twenty years
the wife becomes the sole director of the property,
which she manages with care and
wisdom, and the only guardian of the children
left in her charge.</p>

<p>The peasants who still cling to the soil
plod away at their daily toil in very much
the same way as the Bulgarians, but show a
greater aptitude for rearing the silkworm and
growing olives and grapes. The Greek
peasants are not models of perfection; but
as a body they are better than any other
race in Turkey, and under a good government
they are certain to improve and develop
much faster than either the Bulgarians
or the Turks.</p>

<p>The Greek women of the towns, according
to their station and the amount of refinement
and modern ideas they have been imbued
with, display in their manners and mode of
living the virtues and faults inherent in the
Greek character. I must in justice state that
the former exceed the latter; their virtues
consist principally in their quality of good
honest wives, and in the simple lives they
are usually content to lead in their homes.
The enlightenment and conversational talents
of some of the better class do not fall far
short of those of European ladies. Those
less endowed by education and nature have
a quiet modest bearing, and evince a great
desire to improve. The most striking faults
in the Greek woman’s character are fondness
of dress and display, vanity, and jealousy of
the better circumstances of her neighbors.
The spirit of envious rivalry in dress and
outward appearance is often carried to such
a pass that the real comforts of home-life are
sacrificed, and many live poorly and dress
meanly on ordinary occasions in order to display
a well-furnished drawing-room and expensive
holiday costumes to the public.
When living in the town of N⸺, I was
taken into the confidence of the Archbishop’s
niece, who was my neighbor. She confessed
to me that on promenade days she regularly
stationed her servant at the end of the street
in order to inspect the toilette of her rival,
the wife of the richest <i>chorbadji</i>, so that she
might be able to eclipse her.</p>

<p>Greek ladies are fond and devoted mothers,
but they are not systematic in rearing their
children. This has, however, been remedied
in many cases by children of both sexes being
placed from a very early age in the care
of governesses, or at school, where the more
regular training they receive cannot fail to
have beneficial results.</p>

<p>The life of women of the working classes
is still more homely and retired, as it is considered
an impropriety to be seen much out
of doors, especially in the case of young
girls, whom prejudice keeps very secluded,
even to the length of seldom allowing them
to go to church. When abroad, however,
their fondness for display is equal to that of
their richer sisters, whose toilettes, however
novel or complicated, in cities like Constantinople
and Smyrna, are sure to be copied by
the fishermen’s or washerwomen’s daughters.
In provincial towns like Rodosto and Adrianople,
the love of dress finds its satisfaction
in bright colors and wreaths of artificial flowers,
especially the much coveted carnation,
when out of season, which is worn by some
as a love-trophy; for it must have been given
by some lover on the feast-day. Greek girls
are very clever at needlework and embroidery;
but their life is nevertheless monotonous,
and they have little variety of occupation
and amusement. This is owing in part
to the exclusion of women of all races in
Turkey from occupations in shops, and to
the absence of manufactories, which, with
the exception of some silk factories, do not
exist in the country. Those in the silk-growing
districts, however, give employment to a
number of Greek girls, who show great aptitude
for this branch of industry, and often
become directresses of establishments in
which Armenian and other women are employed.</p>

<p>The affection of a Greek wife for her husband
is joined to a jealous care of his interest;
she will strive to hide his faults and
weaknesses, and the disinterested devotion
with which she will cling to him in prosperity
and adversity is astonishing. A woman
belonging to the town of S⸺, on hearing
that her husband had been arrested on a
charge of complicity with brigands, left her
home and five children to the care of a blind
grandmother, and set out on foot on a three
days’ journey to the town where he was to
be tried. He was condemned to seven years’
imprisonment, and sent to the prison at
A⸺, whither she followed him. Young
and pretty, entirely friendless, and without
means of subsistence, she lingered about the
Greek quarter until her sad tale gained her an
asylum in a compassionate family. She toiled
hard to gain a small pittance, which she
divided between herself and her unhappy
partner shut up in the common prison. The
dreadful news was brought to her that three
of her children were dead, that her house
was falling to pieces, and that her aged and
afflicted mother was unable to take care of
the two surviving little ones. Unmoved by
these calamities, she refused to quit the town
of A⸺ until, through the instrumentality
of some influential persons whose sympathies
she had enlisted, her husband’s period of
punishment was shortened.</p>

<p>Greek society may be divided into two
classes, the conservative party and the progressive.
The former, in the provincial
towns, are jealous of their rights and privileges
as elders of the community and representatives
of the nation in the <i>Medjliss</i>. In
many instances these side with the authorities
in acts of injustice, sometimes from timidity
and sometimes from interested motives.
This small retrograde class is also strongly
opposed to the progress of education, and
often hinders it by stint of money and general
hostility to all changes.</p>

<p>The second class consists of the educated
members of the community, who earn their
fortunes in much the same way as the rest of
the civilized world, and spend it liberally in
comforts and luxuries, and for the benefit of
the nation—an object to which every Greek
tries to contribute in some degree. The motto
of this party is <i>Embros!</i> (Forward!)
They are stopped by no difficulties and overcome
by no drawbacks, either in their personal
interests or those of the nation. Their
success in enterprise should no longer (as formerly)
be attributed to disloyalty, dishonesty,
and intrigue—in these respects there is no
reason for believing them worse than their
neighbors—but to the wonderful energy and
ability they show in all their undertakings.
I heard a conversation some time ago between
two medical celebrities of Constantinople
with reference to the Greek spirit of
enterprise and ambition. One praised their
enterprise as a promising quality, and, to use
his own expression, said, “There is an immense
amount of ‘go’ in the Greek.”</p>

<p>“Go!” repeated the other, waxing hot,
“Too much so, I believe: there is no telling
where a Greek’s enterprising spirit may not
lead him, or where his ambition will stop!
Listen to my experience on the subject and
judge for yourself. Some years ago I was
asked by a good old Greek I knew very well
to take his son, a youth of twenty, into my
service. According to the father’s recommendation,
he was a good Greek scholar
and knew a little Latin. I asked the father
in what capacity I was to engage him.
‘Any you like,’ was the reply: ‘let him be
your servant—your slave.’ ‘Very well; but
he will have to clean my boots and look after
my clothes!’ ‘πολὺ καλὰ’ was the response,
and I engaged his son.</p>

<p>“On the following day my new valet entered
upon his duties. He was a good-looking,
smart, and intelligent fellow, and at first
exact and able in the performance of his
functions; but gradually he became lax, absent
in manner, and negligent; although
steady and quiet in his conduct. One day
the mystery of this change was revealed on
my returning home unexpectedly, and finding
the fellow, instead of cleaning my boots,
which he held in his hand, deeply plunged in
one of the medical works on my table. In
my anger at seeing my papers and books
meddled with, I brought my boots into contact
with his head, telling him that if ever I
caught him again at that sort of thing, he
would be punished more severely. ‘Forgive
me,’ said he, in a very penitent manner, and
walked demurely out of the room. He
showed, however, no signs of improvement,
and subsequently I discovered him committing
no less a piece of impertinence than
copying some prescriptions that lay on my
desk. This was too much; so, as a punishment,
I made him take one of the potions;
but on the next day he calmly told me that
the <i>iatrico</i> had done him good, having calmed
his blood and cleared his head! Of course,
I dismissed the fellow and replaced him by
an Armenian, who answered my purpose better,
though he did dive now and then rather
extensively into the larder. For some years
I lost sight of my former valet, and had forgotten
his very existence till it was brought
to my recollection in the following unexpected
manner. I one day received a pressing
message to go at once to the house of
D⸺ Pasha to see a sick child and hold a
consultation with his new <i>hekim bashi</i> (doctor)
on its case. At the appointed hour I went,
and on entering the konak was ushered into
the selamlik to await the arrival of the other
doctor who was to lead me into the harem.
In a few minutes my supposed colleague
walked in, hat and gold-headed stick in one
hand, while the other was extended to me,
with the words ‘καλημέρα, ἴατρε’(good-morning,
doctor). The face and voice transfixed
me for a moment, but the next presented to
me the fact that my former valet stood before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
me, claiming the right of holding a consultation
with me. Whereat I was on the
point of giving vent to my indignation, by
seizing him by the collar and ejecting him
from the apartment, when he quietly said,
‘Excuse me, ἴατρε, but I stand before you in
right of the diploma I have obtained from
Galata Serai. Allow me to submit it to your
learned and honorable inspection.’ There
was no denying the fact; the fellow’s diploma
was in perfect order. My anger cooling,
I consented to consult with him, when he
again incensed me by venturing to take a
view of the case opposed to mine. His opposition,
however, was only momentary; for,
taking the upper hand, I dictated my directions
to him, and he, yielding with a good
grace to my experience, carried out my orders
with great precision. I had subsequently
many opportunities of meeting him,
and must in justice say that he turned out
one of the best pupils of Galata Serai, and
the most grateful man I have ever known.
He is at present attached to the Red Cross
Society, to which he gives the greatest satisfaction.”</p>

<p>In feature and build the modern Greek still
possesses the characteristic traits of his ancestors.
Scientific researches and anatomical
observations made upon the skulls of ancient
Greeks are said to prove that if art had glorified
to a slight extent the splendid models of
statues, it could not have strayed very far
from the originals. Such pure and perfect
types are constantly met with at the present
day in the modern Greeks, who, as a rule,
possess fine open foreheads, straight noses,
and fine eyes full of fire and intelligence,
furnished with black lashes and well-defined
eyebrows; the mouths are small or of medium
size, with a short upper lip; the chin
rather prominent, but rounded. The entire
physiognomy differs so essentially from the
other native types that it is impossible to mistake
it. In stature the Greek is rather tall
than otherwise, well made and well proportioned;
the hands and feet are small in both
sexes. The walk is graceful, but has a kind
of swagger and ease in it, which, although
it looks natural in the national costume,
seems affected in the European dress.</p>

<p>The distinct Greek type, so noticeable in
certain localities, has in others suffered from
the admixture with foreign elements; but we
find it again in all its perfection in the inhabitants
of the coast of Asia Minor, where the
Greeks were at one epoch so crushed and
denationalized as to have lost the use of their
mother-tongue. Some of the finest specimens
of the Greek race may be found in
Smyrna, Gemlek, and Philadar, as well as
in more inland places, such as Mahalitch,
Demirdesh, and Kellessen.</p>

<p>The influence and effects of the last and
most important change must be carefully followed
and the transformation already wrought
upon the nation taken into consideration before
a fair and impartial estimate of the character
of the present Greeks can be arrived at.
The nation in its present scattered condition
presents great variety and dissemblance;
but even these points, in my opinion, constitute
its force and guarantee its future prosperity.
No person well acquainted with
modern Greece can contest the vast improvement
in the national character during the last
half century, the moral development already
gained, and the prosperous condition the little
kingdom has now entered upon. The educated
and enlightened <i>rayah</i> follows closely
in the footsteps of his liberated kinsmen, and
bids fair some day to catch them up. Until
recent times the real advance in the Greek
character seems to have escaped the notice of
European critics, and in obedience to ancient
prejudice it is still the fashion to cry down
the future queen of South-East Europe. A
charitable Prussian diplomatist, writing with
more zeal than knowledge, gave the following
flattering portrait of the Greeks of Constantinople
at the end of the last century;</p>

<p>“Le quartier est la demeure de ce qu’on appelle
la noblesse grecque, qui vivent tous aux
dépenses des princes de Moldavie et de Valachie.
C’est une université de toutes les scélératesses,
et il n’existe pas encore de langue
assez riche pour donner des noms à toutes
celles qui s’y commettent. Le fils y apprend
de bonne heure à assassiner adroitement son
père pour quelque argent qu’il ne saurait être
poursuivi. Les intrigues, les cabales, l’hypocrisie,
la trahison, la perfidie, surtout l’art
d’extorquer de l’argent de toutes mains, y
sont enseignés méthodiquement!”</p>

<p>An English author of more recent date, but
neither more enlightened nor animated with
a greater sense of justice or impartiality, denies
their right to a national history or their
possession of an ancestry, furnishing them
instead with one out of his fertile imagination.
According to him several millions of
Greeks are nameless, homeless upstarts, who
have invariably made their fortunes by following
the trade of <i>bakals</i>, or chandlers, and,
with the enormous and illegal profits of their
business, send their sons to Athens to be educated
and receive a European varnish, then
to return to Turkey full of pretension and
bad morals, to sow discord and create mischief
among their less enlightened brethren.
Such absurd statements carry their own refutation;
but they mislead people who are
already prejudiced and ready to believe anything
bad of the Greeks. The general currency
such erroneous assertions receive, even
in England, the country of Byron and the
seamen of Navarino, struck me in a remark
lately made by an intelligent English boy of
twelve, who, happening to hear the Greeks
mentioned at the luncheon-table, asked his
mother if all the Greeks were not cut-throats?</p>

<p>These fallacies are gradually being cleared
away. As a nation the Greeks possess undeniable
virtues and talents, which, properly
encouraged and guided, have in them the
making of a strong progressive people—such
as one day the Greeks will assuredly be.
Their faults are as distinct and prominent as
their virtues. In the careful and impartial
examination a long residence has enabled me
to make of the character of this people, I
discovered a good deal of vanity, bravado,
and overweening conceit. They are vain of
their ability, and still more vain of the merits
and capacity of free Hellas, of which they
are so enamoured as to consider this little
kingdom, in its way, on a level with the
Great Powers. The spirit of bravado is often
shown in animated disputes and controversies,
for which they have a great partiality.
They are subtle, extremely sensitive,
fond of gain, but never miserly. Their
enthusiastic nature, given free scope, will
lead them into the doing of golden deeds;
and, in the same way, bad influence will
make of some the most finished rogues in
creation. No Greek thief of Constantinople
will be beaten in daring or in the art of carrying
out a <i>coup de main</i>. No assassin will
more recklessly plunge his knife into the
heart of an enemy, no seducer be more
enticing, no brigand more dashing and
bold. And yet in the worst of these there
is some redeeming quality; a noble action
polluted by many bad ones; crimes
often followed by remorse and a return to a
steady and honest life. Gratitude for a good
service is always met with among the Greeks,
as among the Albanians. An example of
this may be seen in an adventure that more
than twenty years ago happened to an Englishman
in the Government employ, who was
travelling in a province infested by brigands.
Armed and accompanied by a good escort,
Mr. F. had set out during the night for the
town of L⸺, and following the impulse of
an adventurous spirit, he strayed away from
his companions in a dense forest. The light
of a full moon made the path quite distinct,
and he had proceeded some distance, when his
bridle was suddenly seized by some fierce-looking
fellows, who appeared by his side as
if by magic. Mr. F.’s surprise was as great
as the action was menacing; but he instantly
seized his revolver, and thought on the prudence
of using it, when the “capitan,” a
regular <i>leromenos</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> sprang forward, and a
struggle ensued for its possession, in which
the weapon was broken. The moment was
critical, the danger imminent, for self-defence
was out of the question with a broken revolver.
In this emergency, with the presence
of mind which characterizes him, Mr.
F. thought of another means of protection,
and removing the white cover of his official
cap, pointed out the crown on it, and declared
himself a servant of the British Government.
This had the desired effect, for
the chief released his hold of the bridle, and
retired a short distance with his companions
to hold a consultation, the result of which
was his again stepping forward, and inquiring
if the gentleman was the son of the consul
of the town of T⸺, and being answered
in the affirmative the “capitan,” with much
feeling, declared he was free to pursue his
way, for his father had rendered many good
and noble services to the Greek families of
Thessaly and Epirus, and had saved the lives
and property of many others. “Besides,”
added he, “we love and respect the English.
But a few miles hence you will fall in with the
camp of old A. Pasha, who, with 800 troops
and two guns, intends to surround yonder
mountain, where he expects to entrap and
chase us like wild beasts. The price of your
freedom is your word of honor not to reveal to
him your meeting with us until to-morrow;
when that is given, your escort will be allowed
to pass unmolested.” Mr. F. then continued
his journey, and a couple of hours brought
him to the camp of his friend the brigand-chasing
Pasha, who gave him an excellent
supper, and entertained him with the plan
of his next day’s assault on the brigand band,
to which he had patiently to listen, bound as
he was by his word not to reveal what he
knew of their whereabouts until the next day.
As the game the Pasha expected to entrap
escaped him on the morrow, the revelation
naturally annoyed him; but he was too well
aware of the value an Englishman placed
upon his pledged word, even to a brigand,
to find fault with the reticence of his friend
on that occasion.</p>

<p>The Greek aristocracy has almost disappeared,
and the nation seems now eminently
democratic, though fond of giving titles to
persons of position, such as “Your Worship,”
“Your Honor,” “Your Highness,”
etc., and “Your Holiness” to the clergy.
Such terms are smoothly introduced in epistolary
addresses or used in conversation, so
long as this is carried on with calmness and
reflection; but directly discussion becomes
animated, and the speaker, whatever his
condition, excited, all such high-flown phrases
are discarded and exchanged for that more
natural to the Greek fraternal feeling, the
word “Adelphé” (brother), which never
fails to grate upon the ear of Englishmen in
the East.</p>

<p>It certainly had this effect upon one of our
old consuls who had rather a hasty temper
and was a strict observer of etiquette. On
one occasion he had to listen to an excited
Greek who had a dispute with another, and
heard the title of Adelphé addressed to him
by the complainant, who, to make matters
worse, was by no means such a respectable
person as could be wished. The indignant
consul exclaimed in Greek, “Brother! I am
no brother of yours!” and was proceeding
to render his assurance more effectual by a
vigorous and unexpected movement of his
foot, when he lost his balance and was
stretched on the floor. This unforeseen aspect
of affairs appeared so comical to him
that he indulged in a hearty peal of laughter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
in which the Greek, though politely asking
after his injuries, joined—in his sleeve.</p>

<p>The charges raised most frequently against
the Greeks are their want of honesty in their
dealings with strangers, and their general
unscrupulousness in business transactions.
These accusations, in great part well founded,
are due to the unnatural position in which
the rayah is placed. Every Greek who is
truly a Greek in heart (and I have known
few who were not so) must detest and dislike
his rulers, and direct his energies to promoting,
openly or secretly, the interest of his
nation. In order to do this, however, he
must work in the dark, and strive to undermine
the interests of his masters; consequently
the mask of hypocrisy has to be
worn by all in the same way. To cheat the
Turks in small matters when he can, in revenge
for grosser injuries he is liable to receive
from them, becomes one of his objects.
His is not the only subject race that evinces
a laxity of principle and want of morality in
the transaction of business. He is sharp in
its despatch, perhaps sharper than some
others, but no worse than they in the manner
in which he carries on his trade.</p>

<p>I have often heard this subject discussed
in all its bearings, and the statements of European
as well as native merchants appeared
to agree on the main point—that with the
corrupt administration, and the perpetual
necessity of having recourse to bribery in
order to facilitate the course of business,
honest and straightforward dealing was out
of the question. “We must,” said a wealthy
French merchant, “do in Turkey as the
Turks do, or else seek a fortune elsewhere.”
The following incident out of innumerable
others will give an idea of how enterprise is
encouraged and business carried on in this
country.</p>

<p>Some Jews in the town of L⸺ had established
a soap factory, producing a bad article
and selling it at high prices. Subsequently
some Cretan Greeks set up a rival
establishment in the same town. The Cretans
enjoyed a great repute in Turkey for this
branch of industry, and offered their soaps
to the public at a lower price than the Jews,
who were thrown into the shade; these
therefore had to invent some plan to ruin
their rivals. Both factories imported their
own oil from the Greek islands, and paid the
duties in kind or in cash. The Greeks
adopted the former method, and the Jews,
aware of the fact, presented themselves at
the custom-house, estimated the oil the
Greeks received at double its value, and transported
a portion of it to their premises, thus
obliging the Greeks to pay double duty—a
serious matter, which, if not remedied,
would ruin their business. They decided
upon offering the Jews privately half of the
extra duty they were called upon by them to
pay to the revenue. But on a second cargo
of oil being imported they abstained from
paying that sum to the Jews, who thereupon
made them pay double duty a second time,
which so exasperated the Greeks that they
resolved to have their revenge. So, sending a
fresh order for oil, they instructed their
agent to have two of the barrels filled with
water, and marked with some sign. This
cargo on arriving was left by the Greeks in
the custom-house until the Friday afternoon
when they went to clear it. The Jews, made
aware of this fact by their spies, also presented
themselves, estimated the oil, as formerly,
at double its value, and offered to purchase
the two barrels left as payment of
duty. The Greeks prolonged the affair until
there was only just time for the Jews to take
away their purchase, but not to inspect it
without breaking the Sabbath. On the following
evening the Jews discovered the trick
that had been played upon them, and exposed
it to the custom-house officials, demanding redress.
The Greeks, summoned to appear and
answer the charge, denied that the swindle
had been practised by them, and exposed the
dishonest dealings of the Jews towards them,
saying that it must have been they who abstracted
the oil and replaced it with water,
with the object of cheating the Customs.
The authorities, unwilling to take further
trouble about the matter, sent away both
parties, and would have nothing more to do
with the case. The Jews in the mean time
were inconsolable; and when the Cretans
thought they had been sufficiently punished,
they confessed the trick, and offered to make
amends by refunding the money they had
paid for the casks if they would go with
them to the Rabbi and take an oath to make
no more attempts to injure their business by
dishonest means.</p>

<p>The principal Greek merchants trade under
foreign protection, as it affords them
greater security and freedom from the intrigues
of the ill disposed.</p>

<p>To sum up. The subject Greek of Turkey
has his vices: he is over-ambitious, conceited,
too diplomatic and wily; and, in
common with most merchants, European or
Eastern, in Turkey, he does his best to cheat
the Turks—and occasionally extends the
practice further, not without excellent precedent.
But these are the vices of a race
long kept in servitude and now awaking to
the sense of a great ancestry: the servitude
has produced the servile fault of double-dealing
and dishonesty; and the pride of a noble
past has engendered the conceit of the present.
Such vices are but passing deformities:
they are the sharp angles and bony length of
the girl-form that will in time be perfected in
beauty. These faults will disappear with the
spread of education and the restoring of freedom
long withheld. The quick intellect and
fine mettle of the Greek, like his lithe body, descended
from a nation of heroes, are destined
to great things. The name alone of Hellenes
carries with it the prescriptive right of speaking
and doing nobly; and the modern Hellenes
will not disown their birthright.</p>

</div>

<p>The Albanians, like most of the races of
minor importance inhabiting European Turkey,
are little known to the civilized world.
Albania, with its impassable mountains,
broken by deep and precipitous ravines, the
footways of torrents, has been visited only by
those few travellers who have had enough
courage and adventurous spirit to penetrate
into its fastnesses. This country, occupying
the place of the ancient Illyria and Epirus,
was in the middle ages called Arvanasi, and
later on Arnaoutlik by the Turks and
Arvanitia by the Greeks; but in the native
tongue it is called Skiperi, or “land of rocks.”
It is divided into Upper and Lower Albania,
and forms two vilayets, that of Scutari (comprising
the provinces of Berat, El Bassan,
Ochrida, Upper and Lower Dibra, Tirana,
Candia, Duratzo, Cruia, Tessi, Scutari, Dulcigno,
and Podgoritza), and that of Joannina,
in Epirus (comprising Joannina, Konitza,
Paleopogoyani, Argyrokastro, Delvino, Parakalanio,
Paramythia, Margariti, Leapourie
or Arbar, and Avlona).</p>

<p>Owing to the mountainous character of the
country, and the turbulent and warlike disposition
of its inhabitants, it is still unexplored
in many parts, poorly cultivated in
others, and everywhere much neglected in its
rich and fertile valleys. Unfortunately agriculture,
still in a very primitive and neglected
condition throughout Turkey, is especially so
in Albania. This neglect, however prejudicial
to the well-being of the inhabitants,
rather heightens the wild beauty of the
scenery, the changing grandeur and loveliness
of which alternately awes and delights
the traveller.</p>

<p>Shut out from the civilized world by the
want of roads and means of communication,
all the natural advantages the country possesses
have remained stationary, and its
beauty and fertility turned to little account
by the wild and semi-savage population that
inhabits it.</p>

<p>The principal productions of Illyrian Albania
are horses, sheep, and oxen, reared in
the valleys of the Mousakia; grain is extensively
grown at Tirana; and rye and Indian
corn are grown in El Bassan; and in some
parts of Dibra a coarse kind of silk is manufactured
into home-spun tissues, and used
for the elaborate embroidery of the picturesque
national costume. A stout felt used
for the <i>capa</i>, or cloak, is made of wool. A
kind of red leather, and other articles of
minor importance, are also manufactured in
these parts.</p>

<p>Epirus, or Lower Albania, owing to its
more favorable situation and the mildness of
its climate, is by far the more fertile and better
cultivated of the two vilayets. In addition
to the above-mentioned products, it
grows rice, cotton, olives, tobacco, oranges,
citrons, grapes, and cochineal. Though
agriculture is carried on in the same primitive
manner, richer harvests are produced,
and, as shown by the yearly returns, there is
a steady increase of the export trade.</p>

<p>Albania abounds in minerals, but the mines
are little known, still less worked. Hot
springs, possessing valuable medicinal qualities,
are also to be found in many places, but
the country people are totally ignorant of
their properties, and take the waters indiscriminately
for any ailments they may happen
to have, and, in obedience to the old
superstitious reverence for the spirits of the
fountains, even drink from several different
sources in the hope of gaining favor with
their respective nymphs.</p>

<p>The large landowners, both in Upper and
Lower Albania, are Mohammedans, often
perverted from Christianity. They still exercise
a despotic and unlimited control over
the peasants, and show the convert’s proverbial
spirit of intolerance towards their
brethren who hold fast the faith of their fathers.
At the beginning of this century, and
before Ali Pasha had made himself the complete
master of Joannina, much of the landed
property in Lower Albania was held by Christians,
and many semi-independent villages,
entirely inhabited by Christians, were to be
found scattered all over the country. Their
number was sadly diminished during the
revolutionary convulsion that upset the country.
The property of many Christian landholders
experienced the same fate. Their
estates were snatched from their lawful owners
by the wily, avaricious, and hypocritical
despot, who, employing by turns the three
methods of force, fraud, and nominal compensation,
drove away the owners and appropriated
the lands to himself. After his
death all these lands passed to the crown as
<i>Imlak</i> property, and were never restored to
their former possessors.</p>

<p>The landed property in both Upper and
Lower Albania still retains much of the characteristics
of the species of feudal system
which once prevailed throughout Turkey;
but instead of the rule of a few powerful
Beys or one single despot, a legion of petty
tyrants hold the people in bondage. Yet
there may be found among the landholders
a few, poorer than the rest, who are respected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
for their integrity and for their paternal treatment
of the peasants on their estates.</p>

<p>The general aspect of the towns and villages
in Upper Albania differs very little from that
of other towns and villages in Turkey. The
same want of finish and clumsiness of workmanship
prevail in all the Albanian houses,
which are usually detached from one another
and stand in court-yards surrounded by high
walls. Some of these dwellings are complete
fortresses; but this is not on account of the
terrible never-ending blood-feuds transmitted
from generation to generation, which make
each man’s life (out-of-doors) the least secure
of his possessions. In times of peace his
house can be left with open gates, and is held
sacred and respected even by the vilest and
most desperate characters; for it is a point
of honor with an Albanian never to incur the
disgrace of shedding a man’s blood in his
own house; but the moment he crosses the
threshold, he is at the mercy of his foe.</p>

<p>An Albanian chieftain, who had a deadly
quarrel with a neighbor and consequently
was in terror of his life, was compelled to
stay within doors for twelve long years, knowing
the risk he ran if the threshold were
crossed. Finally, craving a little liberty, he
obtained an armistice and was allowed perfect
freedom for a short space of time.</p>

<p>In times of open contention the houses are
fortified and guarded by armed bands, who
conceal themselves in strongholds attached to
some of the buildings, watch for the approach
of the enemy, and open fire upon them from
the loop-holes with which the walls are
pierced.</p>

<p>The furniture of their dwelling-houses is
scanty, poor, and comfortless. Some valuable
carpets, a gorgeously embroidered sofa
in the reception-room, and a few indispensable
articles, are all they possess. The streets
are narrow and badly paved, and look dismal
and deserted. The bazars and shops are inferior
to those of most of the towns of Turkey.
They contain no variety of objects for
use or ornament beyond those absolutely
necessary for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>The villages are far more curious and interesting
to the traveller than the towns.
Some of these in Upper Albania, in mountainous
districts, are at a great distance from
each other, and are perched up on the summits
of high rocks that tower above each
other in successive ranges, in some places
forming a natural and impassable rampart to
the village, in others trodden into steep paths
where the goat doubtless delights to climb,
but where man experiences any but agreeable
sensations.</p>

<p>Lower Albania, better known to travellers,
is less rugged and wild in appearance. But
here and there we meet with mountainous
districts—such as the far-famed canton of
Souli, which in the time of Ali Pasha numbered
eleven villages, some scattered on the
peaks of mountains, others studding their
skirts; while the terrible Acheron gloomily
wound its way through the deep gorges that
helped to secure the river its victims.</p>

<p>Souli, defended by its 13,000 inhabitants,
withstood the siege of the dreaded pasha’s
armies, held them in check for fifteen years,
and acquired undying fame in the history of
the war of Greek independence for heroism
hardly surpassed by the most valiant feats
of the ancients, and with which nothing
in modern warfare can compare. Every
Souliot, man, woman, and child, was ready
to perish in the defence. The women and
children who had fought so long by the side
of their husbands and fathers, at the last
extremity, preferring death to captivity and
dishonor, threw themselves from the rocks
into the dark stream below, while the few
that survived the final destruction cut their
way through their enemies, and were scattered
over Greece to tell the sad tale of the fall of
Souli.</p>

<p>The plateau of Joannina is entirely surrounded
by wooded mountains, and is from
1,200 to 1,500 feet above the level of the sea.
On this table-land is a lake about fourteen
miles in length and six in breadth, on the rich
borders of which rises the town of Joannina,
like a fairy palace in an enchanted land.
This town, which contains 25,000 inhabitants,
became the favorite abode of Ali Pasha,
who transformed and embellished it to a considerable
extent, and founded schools and
libraries.</p>

<p>The edifices erected by him were partly
destroyed by his followers, when his power
was supposed to have reached its end,
together with the gilded kiosks and superb
palaces built for his own enjoyment. All
that Joannina can boast of at the present day
is the exceeding beauty of its situation, and
the activity that Greek enterprise has given
to its commerce, and the excellent schools
and syllogæ that have been established and
are said to be doing wonders in improving
and educating the new generation of Epirus.</p>

<p>The Albanians are divided into several distinct
races, each presenting marked features
of difference from the other and occupying
separate districts. Those of Upper Albania
are called Ghegs, and inhabit that portion of
the country called Ghegueria, which extends
from the frontiers of Bosnia and Montenegro
to Berat.</p>

<p>These men are broad-chested, tall, and robust,
have regular features, and a proud,
manly, independent mien. Their personal
attractions are not a little enhanced by their
rich and picturesque national costume—a pair
of cloth gaiters; an embroidered jacket with
open sleeves; a double-breasted waistcoat;
the Greek fustanella (white calico kilt), surmounted
by a cloth skirt opened in front; a
kemer, or leather belt, decorated with silver
ornaments, and holding a pistol, yataghan,
and other arms of fine workmanship. The
whole costume is richly worked with gold
thread. On the head is worn a fez, wider at
the top than round the head, and ornamented
with a long tassel.</p>

<p>The Tosks inhabiting Lower Albania, in
the sandjaks of Avlona and Berat, and the
Tchames and Liaps of the sandjaks of Delvina
and Joannina, designate their country
Tchamouria and Liapouria. These latter are
supposed to be direct descendants of ancient
Hellenes, as they speak the Greek language
with greater purity than the rest; and certainly
some of their characteristic features
bear a great resemblance to those of the ancient
Greeks. All the Albanians of Epirus
use the Greek language, and are more conversant
with it than with Turkish, which in
some places is not spoken at all.</p>

<p>The Tosks are tall and well built, and extremely
agile in all their movements; their
features are regular and intelligent, but like
most Albanians they have a fierce, cruel, and
sometimes cunning cast of countenance, and
a swagger in their gait, by which they can
easily be distinguished from the other races,
even when divested of their national costume.
They are of a warlike and ferocious disposition,
yet they have noble qualities which
atone in some measure for their ferocity and
produce a very mixed impression of the national
character. They are a constant source
of dread to strangers, but objects of implicit
confidence and trust to those who have gained
their friendship and earned their gratitude.</p>

<p>In bravery, trustworthiness, and honor, the
Ghegs bear the palm. No Gheg will scruple
to “take to the road” if he is short of money
and has nothing better to do. If any man he
may meet on the high-road disregards his
command, “<i>Des dour</i>” (stand still), he thinks
nothing of cutting his throat or settling him
with a pistol-shot; but if a Gheg has once
tasted your bread and salt or owes you a debt
of gratitude or is employed in your service,
all his terrible qualities vanish and he becomes
the most devoted, attached, and faithful of
friends and servants. Generally speaking,
the Ghegs are abstemious and not much addicted
to the vices of Asiatics. Women are
respected by them and seldom exposed to the
attacks of brigands or libertines.</p>

<p>These characteristics are so general and so
deeply rooted in the character of the Gheg
that consuls, merchants, and others, who
need brave and faithful retainers, employ
them in preference to men of any other race.</p>

<p>I was once making a journey across country
to a watering-place in Albania and set
out for this deserted and isolated spot with a
capital escort; accompanied moreover by a
wealthy Christian dignitary of the town in
which I had been staying. During a short
halt we made in a mountain gorge to refresh
ourselves with luncheon, near a ruined and
deserted <i>beklemé</i>, or guard-house, suddenly a
fine but savage-looking Albanian appeared before
us. He was followed by several other
sturdy fellows, all armed to the teeth. My
friend turned pale, and the escort, taking to
their guns, stood on the defensive.</p>

<p>But the feeling of fear soon vanished from
my people, as the Albanians approached them,
and instead of uttering the dreaded “<i>Des
dour!</i>” gracefully put their hands on their
breasts and repeated the much more agreeable
welcome word “<i>Merhaba!</i>” The band
chatted with my men, whilst their chieftain
approached my travelling companion, and
entered into conversation with him, every
now and then giving a glance at me with an
expression of wonder on his face. At last
he inquired who I was, and declared he was
astonished at the independent spirit of the
<i>Inglis</i> lady, who, in spite of fatigue and danger,
had ventured so far.</p>

<p>He willingly accepted our offer of luncheon;
first dipping a piece of bread in salt
and eating it. My horse was then brought
up; the chief stood by, and gallantly held
the stirrup while I mounted. I thanked
him, and we rode off at a gallop. After we
had gone some distance on our road, my
friend heaved a deep sigh of relief, and said
to me, “Do you know who has been lunching
with us, holding your stirrup, and assisting
you to mount? It is the fiercest and
most terrible of Albanian brigand chiefs in
this neighborhood! For the last seven years
he and his band have been the terror of this
kaza, in consequence of their robberies and
murders, respecting none but those of your
sex,—guided, I presume, in this by the superstition,
or let us say point of honor, some Albanians
strictly observe, that it is cowardly
and unlucky to attack women.”</p>

<p>An adventure that lately happened to a
friend of mine will show the manner in
which Ghegs remember a good service rendered
them. Some years ago, a few Albanians,
personally known to the gentleman in
question, who owns a large estate in Macedonia,
heard that three of their fellow-countrymen
had got into trouble. Through
the influence Mr. A. possessed with the local
authorities, their release was obtained. The
incident had almost passed out of his memory
when it was unexpectedly recalled at a critical
moment. Some Albanian beys, who had
a spite against Mr. A., in consequence of a
disputed portion of land, resolved to take
advantage of the present state of anarchy and
disorder in the country to have him or his
son assassinated the next time either of them
should visit the estate. The villanous scheme
was intrusted to a band of Albanian brigands
that were known to be lurking in the vicinity
of Mr. A.’s estate. At harvest-time, as he
was about to start for the country, he received
a crumpled dirty little epistle, written in
the Greek-Albanian dialect, to this effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<i>Much esteemed Effendi, and venerated benefactor</i>:</p>

<p>“Some years ago your most humble servant
and his companions were in difficulties.
You saved them from prison and perhaps
from the halter. The service has never been
forgotten, and the debt we owe to you will
be shortly redeemed by my informing you
that the robber band of Albanians in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
vicinity of your chiftlik have received instructions
and have accepted the task of
shooting you down the first time you come
in this direction. I and my valiant men will
be on the look-out to prevent the event if
possible, but we warn you to be on your
guard, for your life is in danger.</p>

<p class="center">“Kissing your hand respectfully,</p>

<p class="center">“I sign myself,</p>

<p class="right">“A MEMBER OF THE VERY BAND!”</p>

</div>

<p>Another friend related to me a strange adventure
he had with an Albanian ex-brigand,
who for some time had been in his service.
This gentleman was a millionaire of the town
of P., who in his younger days often collected
the tithes of his whole district, and
consequently had occasion to travel far into
the interior and bring back with him large
sums of money. During these tours the
faithful Albanian never failed to accompany
his master. On one occasion, however,
when they had penetrated into the wildest
part of his jurisdiction, his servant walked
into the room where he was seated, and after
making his <i>temenla</i>, or salute, said, “Chorbadji,
I shall leave you; therefore I have
come to say to you <i>Allah ’semarladu</i> (good-by).”</p>

<p>“Why,” said the astonished gentleman,
“what is to become of me in this outlandish
place without you?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” was the response, “I leave you because
I have consented to attack and rob you,
and as such an act would be cowardly and
treacherous while I eat your bread and salt,
I give you notice that I mean to do it on the
highway as you return home, so take what
precautions you like, that it may be fair play
between us.” This said, he made a second
<i>temenla</i> and disappeared.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word; going back
to his former profession, he soon found out
and joined a band of brigands, and at their
head waylaid and attacked his former master,
who, well aware of the character of the man
he had to deal with and the dangers that
awaited him, had taken measures accordingly
and provided himself with an escort strong
enough to overpower the brigands.</p>

<p>The Albanians before the Turkish conquest
professed the Christian religion, which, however,
does not appear to have been very deeply
rooted in the hearts of the people; from time
immemorial they were more famous for their
warlike propensities and adventurous exploits
than for their good principles.</p>

<p>After the conquest, Islam, finding a favorable
soil in which to plant itself, made considerable
progress in some districts, where
the inhabitants willingly adopted it in order
to escape persecution and oppression. This
progress, however, was not very extensive
until the time of the famous Iskander Beg, or
Scanderbeg, who played so prominent a <i>rôle</i>
in the history of his country, and whose desertion
of the Mohammedan and adoption of
the Christian religion so exasperated Sultan
Murad that he forthwith ordered that most
of the Christian churches should be converted
into mosques, and that all Epirots
should be circumcised under pain of death.</p>

<p>The second impulse Mohammedanism received
in Albania was under the rule of Ali
Pasha, when whole villages were converted
to Islam, though their inhabitants to this day
bear Christian names, and in some cases the
mother or wife is allowed to retain the faith
of her fathers and will keep her fasts and
feasts and attend her Christian church while
her husband joins the Mussulman congregation.
In those parts of Epirus, however,
where the Greek population was in the majority
and its ignorant though devout clergy
had influence with the people, they held fast
to their religion as they did to their language.</p>

<p>The Mirdites were equally steadfast to their
faith and purpose, and have remained among
the most faithful and devout followers of the
Pope. The number of Roman Catholic Mirdites
is reckoned at about 140,000 souls, scattered
in the different districts of Albania.
They have several bishoprics, and their
bishops and priests are sent from Rome or
Scutari. The Mirdites make fine soldiers,
and have often been engaged by the Porte
as contingent troops, or employed in active
service. They take readily to commerce
and agriculture, and on the whole may be
considered the most advanced and civilized
of the Illyrian Albanians. They might,
however, progress much more rapidly if
their pastors, to whose guidance they submit
themselves implicitly, would follow
the example of the Greeks in Epirus,
and introduce a more liberal course of instruction;
for the education is at present very
limited beyond the religious branches. There
can be no doubt that excessive religious teaching
among ignorant people, though a powerful
preservative of the faith, tends inevitably
to render them narrow-minded, bigoted, and
incapable of self-development.</p>

<p>The Mohammedanism of the Albanians is
not very deeply rooted, nor does it bear the
stamp of the true faith. Followers of the
Prophet in Lower Albania especially may be
heard to swear alternately by the <i>Panaghia</i>
(blessed Virgin) and the Prophet, without appearing
disposed to follow too closely the
doctrines of either the Bible or the Koran.
It is an undoubted fact that the Moslems of
Albania contrast very unfavorably with the
Christians.</p>

<p>The Tosks are held in ill-repute on account
of the difficulty they seem to experience in defining
the difference between treachery and
good faith. They are clever and have made
more progress than the Ghegs in the civilization
that Greece is endeavoring to infuse
among her neighbors. Some of their districts
are worthy of mention, on account of the taste
for learning displayed by their inhabitants,
the earnestness with which they receive instruction,
and the good results that have
already crowned their praiseworthy efforts.</p>

<p>Zagora, for instance, famous as having
afforded shelter to many Greeks after the
conquest of Constantinople, is renowned for
the intelligence and general enlightenment of
its inhabitants. The sterile and unproductive
soil induces the men to rely less upon the
fruits of their manual toil than upon their
mental labor, consequently most of them
migrate to other countries, seeking their
fortune. Some take to commerce, others to
professions, and after realizing a competence
they return to their native land and impart the
more advanced ideas their experience has
given them to their compatriots who have
not enjoyed the same privileges.</p>

<p>The women of Zagora are much esteemed
for their virtues and enlightenment. Such
facts as these make a refreshing contrast to
the dark cloud of ignorance which, in spite
of the pure sky of Albania and the beauty of
the scenery, still hangs thickly on the land,
and casts a shadow where Nature meant all
to be sunshine.</p>

<p>The warlike instincts of the Albanian find
more scope for action in the Mohammedan
than in the Christian religion. They gladly
accept an invitation to fight the battles of the
Porte or those of any nation that will pay
them. This help must, however, be given in
the way most agreeable to themselves, <i>i.e.</i> as
paid contingents under the command of their
own chieftains, to whom they show implicit
obedience and fidelity. Under the beloved
banner of their Bey, legions will collect,
equally ready to do the irregular work of the
Bashi-bazouks or to be placed in the regular
army.</p>

<p>But, as a rule, the Albanian objects to ordinary
conscription, and avoids it, if possible,
by a direct refusal to be enrolled, or
else makes his escape. When on the road
to the seat of war, a regiment of Albanians
is a terrible scourge to the country it passes
through; like locusts, they leave nothing but
naked stalks and barren ground behind them.</p>

<p>The principal merits of the Albanian
soldier are his rapidity of motion, steady aim,
carelessness of life, and hardy endurance in
privation. An Albanian’s gun is his companion
and his means of subsistence in peace
or war. To it he looks for his daily bread
more than to any other source, and he uses it
with a skill not easily matched.</p>

<p>When travelling in Upper Albania we
halted one day in a field which appeared quite
uncultivated and waste, and were making arrangements
for our mid-day meal, when an
Albanian <i>bekchi</i> (forest-keeper) appeared on
the scene and ordered us to quit the spot, as
it was cultivated ground. Our escort remonstrated
with the fellow, saying that it
was the only convenient place near for a
halt, and that now we had alighted we should
remain where we were until we had finished
our meal.</p>

<p>The Albanian, entirely regardless of the
number of the escort and the authority of
government servants, became more persistent
in his commands, and the guards lost patience
and threatened to arrest him and take
him before the Mudir of the town that lay a
little further on. “The Mudir,” scornfully
repeated the mountaineer, “and who told
you that I recognize the authority of the
Mudir?” Then taking his long gun from
his shoulder, he held it up and said, “This is
my authority, and no other can influence me
or acquire any power over me!”</p>

<p>The social relations of the Albanians are
limited to two ideas, <i>Vendetta</i> and <i>bessa</i>
(peace).</p>

<p>In cases of personal insult or offence the
vendetta is settled on the spot. Both parties
stand up, the insulted full of indignation and
thirsting for revenge, the offender repentant,
perhaps, or persistent. The aggrieved person,
even in the former case, seldom yields
to persuasion or softens into forgiveness; he
draws a brace of pistols and presents them to
his antagonist to make his choice. The little
fingers of their left hands are linked together
and they fire simultaneously. A survivor is
rare in such cases, and the feud thus caused
between the relatives of both parties is perpetuated
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>It takes very little to provoke these terrible
blood-feuds, and one or two instances that
have come under my direct notice will suffice
to give an idea of their nature and the violence
with which real or fancied insult is
avenged.</p>

<p>One happened while I was at Uskup. The
cause was nothing more weighty than a contention
between two Albanian sportsmen,
who were disputing the possession of a hare
that each maintained he had shot. The dispute
became so violent that a duel was resorted
to as the only way to settle it. It came
off on the common in the presence of the
combatants’ relatives and friends, who joined
in the quarrel; and a general battle ensued,
in which the women fought side by side with
their husbands and brothers. A girl of seventeen,
a sister of one of the two sportsmen,
fought with the courage of a heroine, and
with a success worthy of a better cause.
Fourteen victims fell on that day. The Governor
of Uskup, who related the story to me,
said that he despaired of ever seeing these
savage people yield to the influence of their
more refined neighbors, or become entirely
submissive to the Sultan’s government. But
great changes have taken place since then
with respect to their submission to the Porte.
The Government is now able almost safely
to send governors and sub-governors into Albania
to collect taxes from such as choose
to pay them, and even draw a certain number
of recruits from the most turbulent and
independent districts.</p>

<p>Another of these lamentable blood-feuds
happened in Upper Dibra, and was witnessed
by one of my friends then living there.</p>

<p>It originated in two lads at the village
fountain throwing stones and breaking the
pitcher of an Albanian girl who had come to
fetch water. This was considered an insult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
to her maidenhood and was at once made the
cause of a serious quarrel by the friends of
the two parties. A fight ensued in which no
less than sixty people lost their lives.
Women’s honor is held in such high esteem
in these wild regions that so trivial an accident
suffices to cause a terrible destruction of life.</p>

<p>Albanian women are generally armed, not
for the purpose of self-defence—no Albanian
would attack a woman in his own country—but
rather that they may be able to join in
the brawls of their male relatives, and fight
by their side. The respect entertained for
women accounts for a strange custom prevalent
among Albanians—that of offering to
strangers who wish to traverse their country
the escort of a woman. Thus accompanied,
the traveller may proceed with safety into
the most isolated regions without any chance
of harm coming to him.</p>

<p>The Albanian women are lively and of an
independent spirit, but utterly unlettered.
Very few of the Mohammedans in Lower
Albania possess any knowledge of reading or
writing. They are, however, proud and
dignified, strict observers of the rules of national
etiquette; and they attach great importance
to the antiquity of their families,
and regulate their marriages by the degrees
of rank and lineage.</p>

<p>The natural beauty of the Albanian girl
soon disappears after she has entered upon
the married state. She then begins to dye
her hair, to which nature has often given a
golden hue, jet black; she besmears her face
with a pernicious white composition, blackens
her teeth, and reddens her hands with
henna; the general effect of the process is to
make her ugly during youth, and absolutely
hideous in old age. The paint they use is
not only most destructive to the complexion,
but also to the teeth, which decay rapidly
from its use. I believe they blacken their
teeth artificially to hide its effects. On my
inquiring the reason of this strange custom
of some Albanian ladies, they laughed at my
disapproval of it, and told me that in their
opinion it was only the fangs of dogs that
should be white.</p>

<p>Both Christian and Mohammedan Albanians,
dissatisfied with the poverty of their
country and their incapability of developing
its natural resources or profiting by them,
often leave it and migrate to other parts of
Turkey in search of employment. Large numbers
seek military service in Turkey, Egypt,
and other countries, or situations as guards,
herdsmen, etc. Some of the Christians study
and become doctors, lawyers, or schoolmasters.
The lower classes are masons, carters,
porters, servants, dairymen, butchers, etc.;
their wives and children seldom accompany
them, but remain at home to look after their
belongings, and content themselves with an
occasional visit from the assiduous bread-winner.</p>

<p>All Albanians call themselves <i>Arkardash</i>
(brothers), and when away from their homes
will assist and maintain the <i>Kapoussis</i>, or
new-comers, until they obtain employment
through the instrumentality of their compatriots
already established in the town. Thus
assistance is given in small towns to the <i>Kapoussis</i>
to defray the expenses of his maintenance
and lodging in the Khan. When he
obtains a place, he repays the money in
small instalments until the debt is acquitted.</p>

<p>The Albanian, generally a gay, reckless
fellow, is always short of money: many
among the better conditioned carry their fortune
on their person in the shape of rich embroideries
on their handsome costumes and
valuable arms. In their belt is contained all
the money they possess. When the fortune-seeker
has to wait a long time for the fickle
goddess to smile upon him, and the forbearance
or generosity of his friends is exhausted,
and the <i>kemer</i> becomes empty, he sells
his fine arms, and the splendid suit of clothes
follows to the same fate. But the Albanian,
though externally transformed, will be by no
means crushed in spirit or at all less conceited
in manner, even when a tattered rag has
replaced the gaudy fez, and a coarse <i>aba</i> his
<i>fustanella</i> and embroidered jacket. With
shoes trodden down at heel he patiently
lounges about under the name of <i>Chiplak</i>
until the expected turn of fortune arrives.
Should it be very long in coming, our Albanian
turns the tables upon the goddess,
shoulders his gun, and takes to the high-road.</p>

<p>The <i>bessa</i>, or truce, is the time Albanians
allow themselves at intervals to suspend their
blood-feuds; it is arranged by mutual consent
between the contending parties, and is
of fixed duration and strictly observed: the
bitterest enemies meet and converse in perfect
harmony and confidence.</p>

<p>The character of the Albanians is simply
the mixed unhewn character of a barbarous
people; they have the rough vices but also
the unthinking virtues of semi-savage races.
If they are not civilized enough not to be
cruel, at least civilization has not yet taught
them its general lesson that honor and chivalry
are unpractical relics of Middle-Age
superstition, quite unworthy of the business-like
man of to-day, whose eyes are steadily
fixed on the main chance. The Albanian,
too, can plunder, but he does it gun in hand
and openly on the highway; not behind a
desk or on ’Change. His faults are the
faults of an untrained violent nature, they
are never mean; his virtues are those of forgotten
days, and are not intended to pay.
He is more often abused than praised, but it
is mostly for want of knowledge; for his
faults are on the surface, whilst his sterling
good qualities are seen only by those who
know him well, and know how to treat him.</p>

<p>The ties that bind this nation to its rulers
have never been those of strict submission,
or of sympathy. The Turkish government
cannot easily forget the troubles and loss of
life the conquest of Albania occasioned, nor
can it feel satisfied with the manner in which
imperial decrees are received by the more turbulent
portion of the inhabitants with regard
to the enrolment of troops and the payment
of taxes; nor pass over the insolence and
even danger to which its officials are often
exposed.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan Albanians on their side
deeply resent the loss of their liberty, and
the forfeiture of their privileges, and reciprocate
to the full the ill feeling and abusive language
of the Turks. The Turk calls the Albanian
<i>Haidout Arnaout!</i> or <i>Tellak!</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Albanian regards the Turk as a doubtful
friend and a corrupt and impotent master;
and if this antipathy exists between the
Turks and the Albanian Moslem, it is scarcely
necessary to say that it is felt far more
strongly between the Turks and the Albanian
Christians of Epirus and the Mirdites, who,
feeling doubly injured by the oppressive rule
to which they are forced to submit, and the
loss of their freedom, ill-brook the authority
of the Porte. The Mirdite turns his looks
and aspirations towards the Slavs, while the
Albanian hopes finally to share the liberty of
the Greek.</p>

<p>The Porte, under these circumstances, had
a difficult mission to fulfil in controlling this
mixed multitude, and was not unjustified in
looking upon it with distrust and suspicion.
It now seems probable, however, that it may
be relieved of the weight of this responsibility.</p>

</div>

<p>The Turkish peasants inhabiting the rural
districts of Bulgaria, Macedonia, Epirus, and
Thessaly, although the best, most industrious,
and useful of the Sultan’s Mohammedan
subjects, everywhere evince signs of poverty,
decrease in numbers, and general deterioration.
This fact is evident even to the mere
traveller, from the wretchedness and poverty-stricken
appearance of Turkish villages,
with their houses mostly tumbling to pieces.
The inhabitants, unable to resist the drain
upon them in time of war when the youngest
and most vigorous men are taken away for
military service, often abandon their dwellings
and retire to more populous villages or
towns: the property thus abandoned goes to
ruin, and the fields in the same manner become
waste. This evil, which has increased
since the more regular enforcement of the
conscription, may be traced to three principal
sources: the first is the unequal manner
in which the conscription laws are carried
out upon this submissive portion of the people;
the second is the want of laborers, the
inevitable consequence of the recruiting system,
whereby the best hands are drawn away
annually at the busiest and most profitable
time of the year, to the great and sometimes
irreparable injury of industry; the third is the
irregular and often unjust manner in which
the taxes are levied. Under these unencouraging
circumstances the disabled old men,
the wild boys, and the women (who are never
trained to work and are consequently unfit
for it), are left behind to continue the labor
of the conscripts, and struggle on as well as
indolent habits and natural incapacity for
hard work will allow them. The large villages
will soon share the fate of the small
ones and be engulfed in the same ruin, unless
radical changes are introduced for the benefit
of the Turkish peasants. Their condition
requires careful and continued attention at
the hands of a good and equitable administration.</p>

<p>The Turkish peasant is a good, quiet, and
submissive subject, who refuses neither to
furnish his Sultan with troops nor to pay his
taxes, so far as in him lies; but he is poor,
ignorant, helpless, and improvident to an almost
incredible degree. At the time of recruiting
he will complain bitterly of his hard
lot, but go all the same to serve his time; he
groans under the heavy load of taxation, gets
imprisoned, and is not released until he manages
to pay his dues.</p>

<p>He is generally discontented with his government,
of which he openly complains, and
still more with its agents, with whom he is
brought into closer contact; but still the idea
of rebelling against either, giving any signs
of disaffection, or attempting to resist the
law, never gets any hold upon him. His
relations with his Christian neighbors vary
greatly with the locality and the personal
character of both. In some places Christian
and Turkish peasants, in times of peace, live
in tolerable harmony, in others a continual
warfare of complaints on one side and acts of
oppression on the other is kept up. The only
means of securing peace to both is to separate
the two parties, and compel each to rest
solely upon its own exertions and resources,
and to prove its worth in the school of necessity.
An English gentleman owning a large
estate in Macedonia used to assert that until
the Christian peasant adopts a diet of beer
and beef, nothing will be made of him; in
the same manner I think that until the Turk
is cured of his bad habit of employing by
hook or by crook Petcho and Yancho to do
his work for him, he will never be able to do
it himself.</p>

<p>The Turkish peasant is well built and
strong, and possesses extraordinary power of
endurance. His mode of living is simple, his
habits sober; unlike the Christians of his
class he has no dance, no village feast, and
no music but a kind of drum or tambourine,
to vary the monotony of his life. His cup
of coffee and his chibouk contain for him all
the sweets of existence. The coffee is taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
before the labors of the day are begun, and
again in the evening at the <i>cafiné</i>. His work
is often interrupted in order to enjoy the chibouk,
which he smokes crouched under a
tree or wall. His house is clean but badly
built, cold in winter and hot in summer, possessing
little in the way of furniture but bedding,
mats, rugs, and kitchen utensils. He
is worse clad than the Christian peasant, and
his wife and children still worse; yet the
women are content with their lot, and in
their ignorance and helplessness do not try,
like the Christian women, to better their condition
by their individual exertions; they are
irreproachable and honest in their conduct,
and capable of enduring great trials. Some
are very pretty; they keep much at home,
the young girls seldom gather together for
fun and enjoyment except at a wedding or
circumcision ceremony, when they sing and
play together, while the matrons gossip over
their private affairs and those of their neighbors.
The girls are married young to peasants
of their own or some neighboring village.
Polygamy is rare among Turkish peasants,
and they do not often indulge in the
luxury of divorce.</p>

<p>On the whole the Turkish peasant, though
not a model of virtue, is a good sort of man,
and would be much better if he had not the
habit in times of national trouble to take
upon him the name of Bashi-Bazouk, and to
transform himself into a ruffian.</p>

<p>Turks, generally speaking, prefer town to
country life; for in towns they enjoy more
frequent opportunities of indulging in that
<i>dolce far niente</i> which has become an integral
part of the Turkish character and has entirely
routed his original nomadic disposition.</p>

<p>The tradespeople of the towns are ranged
into <i>esnafs</i>, or guilds, and form separate corporations,
some of which include Christians
when they happen to be engaged in the same
pursuits. Thus there are the <i>esnafs</i> of barbers,
linen-drapers, greengrocers, grooms,
etc. These bodies, strange to say, in the
midst of general disunion and disorganization,
are governed by fixed laws and regulations
faithfully observed by Christians and
Turks alike, and the rival worshippers, bound
only by the obligation of good faith and
honor towards each other, pull together much
better and show a greater regard for justice
and impartiality than is evinced by any other
portion of the community. Every corporation
elects one or two chiefs, who regulate
all disputes and settle any difficulties that
may arise among the members. These <i>Oustas</i>,
or chiefs, are master-workmen in their
different trades. The apprentices are called
<i>Chiraks</i>, and obtain promotion, according to
their ability, after a certain number of years.
When considered sufficiently advanced in
their business, the master, with the consent
and approval of the corporation, admits them
into the fraternity, and gives them the choice
of entering into partnership with him or beginning
business on their own account.</p>

<p>The grooms yearly elect a chief in each
town, called <i>Seis Bashi</i>, through whom, for a
small fee, grooms may be obtained with
greater security than otherwise for their good
behavior and capability. The meetings, or
<i>lonjas</i>, of this <i>esnaf</i>, are held pretty frequently
in coffee-houses, where the affairs of the
corporation are regulated, and the meeting
generally terminates in an orgy; after which
the grooms retire to their stables, much the
worse for the wine and <i>raki</i> they have drunk.</p>

<p>Once a year each of the associations gives
a picnic, either on the feast of the patron saint
or at the promotion of an apprentice. On
such occasions a certain sum is collected from
the members, or taken from the reserve fund
which some of the <i>esnafs</i> possess, for the
purchase of all kinds of provisions needed
for a substantial and sometimes even sumptuous
meal, to which not only all the members
of the guild are invited, irrespective of
creed and nationality, but also all strangers
who may happen to pass the place where the
feast is held. The amusements include music
and dancing for the Christians, and a variety
of other entertainments, always harmless and
quite within the bounds of decorum, and
joined in with the spirit of joviality that
characterizes these gatherings; disputes are
of rare occurrence, and the greatest harmony
is displayed throughout the day between
Christian and Mussulman. When the interests
of the Mohammedans are closely connected
with those of the Christians, both willingly
forego something of their usual intolerance
in order to further the cause of business. It
is strange and regrettable that this spirit of
association among the lower orders should
receive so little encouragement from the Government
and the higher classes.</p>

<p>Though the Mohammedans in certain
localities and under such circumstances as
those I have mentioned are just in their
dealings with the Christians, and maintain a
friendly feeling towards them; in others, especially
in inland towns, the growing prosperity
of the Christians excites a bitter feeling
among their Turkish neighbors, who
often offer open hostility and inflict irreparable
injury on their business and property.
Many incidents of this nature have come under
my notice, and lead me to the conclusion
that the non-progressiveness of the Turks
and the rapid decline of their empire is partly
due to the unfortunate and insurmountable
incongeniality existing between the Turks
and Christians. The Turks, as the dominant
race, assumed total ascendancy over the
Christians, got into the habit of using them
as tools who acted, worked, and thought for
them in an irresponsible fashion, and thus
lost the power of doing for themselves, together
with the sense of seeing the necessity
of dealing with justice, generosity, and impartiality,
which alone could have guaranteed
enterprise or secured confidence and sympathy
between the two classes. Unfortunately
for the Turks this has brought about a
state of permanent antipathy between the
two that can never be corrected; nor can any
reconciliation be arrived at unless these
classes become entirely independent of one
another. Any arrangement short of this, as
any person well informed as to the actual relations
of Turks and Christians, be they
Greeks or Bulgarians, will admit, must be of
short duration, and before long there could
not fail to come a recurrence of outbreaks,
revolutions, and the usual atrocities that accompany
disorder among these races.</p>

<p>The Turks, generally speaking, are not active
or intelligent in business, and do not
venture much into speculation or commercial
transactions of any great importance. For
example, one never hears of their undertaking
banking, or forming companies for the
purpose of working mines, making railways,
or any other enterprise involving risk and requiring
intelligence, activity, system, and
honesty to insure success. The first reason
for this strange neglect in a people who possess
one of the finest and most productive
countries in the world is a naturally stagnant
and lethargic disposition; another is the
want of the support of the Government,
which has never shown itself earnestly desirous
of aiding private enterprise or guaranteeing
its success by affording disinterested
protection. Until very recent times no pains
have been taken either by individuals or by
the Government to introduce those innovations
and improvements which the times demand.
The consequence is that the Turkish
tradespeople gradually find the number of
their customers decrease, while the Greeks,
Franks, and others successfully supply the
public with the new articles, or the old ones
improved and better fashioned. To give an
instance of this I will repeat an incident related
to me by a Turkish bey of “La Jeune
Turquie” as a lamentable proof of the non-progressiveness
of the masses. “When at
Stamboul,” said he, “I had during some time
to pass by the shop of a Turkish basket-maker
who, with two of his sons, one grown
up and the other a boy, might be seen working
at the wicker hampers and common
baskets which have been used in the country
from time immemorial, but are now less used
by reason of the superiority of those brought
from Europe or made in the school for mechanical
arts in Stamboul, an institution not
much appreciated by the artisans who enjoy
the liberty of going themselves or sending
their children to learn the innovations in
their different branches of industry. The
basket-maker and his sons were evidently a
steady-going set, representing the honest
Turks of olden time, but seemed to be struggling
for a livelihood. Feeling an interest in
them, I one day stopped and asked the old
man what he realized per diem by the sale of
his baskets. He heaved a deep sigh, glanced
round his dismal shop, ornamented only
with dust-covered baskets, and said, ‘Very
little, from three to six piastres (6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i>);
for my business, once a thriving one, is now
cast into the shade, and few customers come
to buy the old Turkish baskets.’ ‘Why then
do you not give it up and take to something
else?’</p>

<p>“‘No, it did very well for my father, who
at his death recommended me to continue it
and leave it to my sons and grandsons, who
should also be brought up to the trade. I
have done so, but it is a hard struggle for
three of us to live by it.’</p>

<p>“I then suggested that one or more of his
sons should learn the new method of basket-making,
which would improve his business
at once. This idea did not seem to be received
favorably by the old man and the eldest
son; but the boy caught at it and asked
if he could go and learn. Encouraged by his
evident willingness, I prevailed upon the father
to allow me to place his son in the Industrial
School, where I hear he has made
certain progress in his art.” The Turkish
mechanic has no power of invention, and his
work lacks finish; but he is capable of imitating
with some success any design shown
to him.</p>

<p>The life led by the Turkish tradespeople is
extremely monotonous and brightened by no
intellectual pleasures. The shopkeeper, on
leaving his house at dawn, goes to the coffee-house,
takes his small cup of coffee, smokes
his pipe, chats with the <i>habitués</i> of the place,
and then proceeds to his business, which is
carried on with Oriental languor throughout
the day. At sunset he again resorts to the
coffee-house to take the same refreshment
and enjoy the innovation of having a newspaper
read to him—a novelty now much appreciated
by the lower classes. He then returns
to the bosom of his family in time for
the evening meal. His home is clean though
very simple; his wife and daughters are ignorant
and never taught a trade by which
they might earn anything. Embroidery, indispensable
in a number of useless articles
that serve to figure in the <i>trousseau</i> of every
Turkish girl, and latterly coarse needle and
crochet work, fill up part of the time, while
the mothers attend to their household affairs.
The young children are sent to the elementary
school, and the boys either go to school
or are apprenticed to some trade.</p>

<p>A considerable proportion of the Turks belong
to the army. The officers, however,
unlike those of their class in Europe, do not
enjoy the prestige or rank to which the merits
of the profession entitle them. It follows
that the individuality of the officer is not
taken into account: if he possesses any special
ability, it is overlooked so long as superiority
of rank does not enforce it and obtain
for him proper respect from soldiers and civilians.
A Turkish captain does not receive
much more consideration from his senior officer
than does a common private; and in a
moment of anger his colonel or general may
strike and use foul and abusive language to
him: a major is barely secure from such
treatment. There are certainly men of merit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and education among the officers of the
Turkish army, whose behavior, like that of
the soldiers, is much praised by those who
have had the opportunity of seeing the admirable
manner in which they conducted
themselves in the late war. Unfortunately it
is principally in individual cases that this
can be admitted, and it can by no means apply
to the whole body of officers.</p>

<p>When not in active service Turkish officers
generally have their wives and families in
the towns in which they are stationed. The
pay of an officer under the rank of a general
is very inadequate and is irregularly received—a
fact sadly evident in their neglected and
disordered appearance. With boots down at
heel and coats minus half the buttons, they
may often be seen purchasing their own food
in the market and carrying it home in their
hands.</p>

<p>The young officers who have pursued their
studies in the military schools present a
marked contrast to these. They are well
dressed and have an air of smartness, and in
military science they are said to be far more
advanced than those who have preceded
them. The training they receive, however,
is by no means a perfect one, and much will
be needed before the Turkish officer can rise
to a level with the European.</p>

<p>Their wives are women from the towns;
as they generally follow their husbands to
the different stations allotted to them, they
obtain some knowledge of the world by travelling
in various parts of the country, and are
conversable and pleasant to associate with.</p>

<p>The sons of all good and wealthy families
in the capital are either placed in the military
schools or sent to the <i>Kalem</i> (Chancellerie
d’État), where the majority of the upper
class Turkish youth are initiated into official
routine and receive different grades as they
proceed, the highest rank accorded corresponding
with that of <i>Serik</i> (general of division).
The officials who pass through this
school are generally more polished in manner,
more liberal in their ideas, and superior
in many respects to the mean creatures who
in former times were intrusted with offices
for which they were quite unfit. This practice
of appointing <i>Chiboukjis</i> (pipe-bearers)
and other persons of low origin as <i>Mudirs</i>
(governors of large villages) and <i>Kaimakams</i>
(governors of districts), is now less in force,
and is limited to Governors-general, who
sometimes send their servants to occupy
these positions. A Mudir may become a
Kaimakam, and a Kaimakam a Pasha, but
the top ranks can be obtained without passing
through the lower grades. The inferior
official placed over each village is the <i>Mukhtar</i>.
He may be Christian or Moslem, according
to the population; in mixed villages two are
generally chosen to represent the respective
creeds. These functionaries are intrusted
with the administration of the village; they
collect the taxes, and adjust the differences
that arise among the peasants. They are too
insignificant to do much good or much harm,
unless they are very vicious. The Mudirs
are at the head of the administration of their
villages and of the medjliss or council, in
which members chosen by the people take
part. <i>Mutessarifs</i> are sub-governors of <i>Kazas</i>
or large districts, and <i>Valis</i>, Governors-general
of vilayets.</p>

<p>All this body of officials, together with the
<i>Defterdars</i> (treasurers), <i>Mektebjis</i> (secretaries
of the Pashalik), <i>politico memours</i> (political
agents), etc., taken as a whole, are seldom
fitted for their posts: they are ignorant and
unscrupulous and much more bent upon securing
their personal interests than the welfare
of their country.</p>

<p>It must, however, in justice be said that,
owing to the large sums the higher officials
have to disburse in order to obtain their appointments,
the great expense entailed in frequently
moving themselves and their families
from one extremity of the empire to the
other, and the irregular and meagre pay the
minor officials receive, it is impossible for
them to live without resorting to some illicit
means of increasing their incomes. And it
must be admitted that praiseworthy exceptions
are to be found here and there among
both the higher and the lower officials.</p>

<p>The case is very simple. A man has to
pay a vast sum of money to various influential
people in order to get a certain post. His
pay is nothing much to speak of. He is liable
to be ejected by some one’s caprice at
any moment. If he is to repay his “election
expenses” and collect a small reserve fund,
he must give up all idea of honesty. An
honest official in Turkey means a bankrupt.
Under the system of favoritism and bribery
no course but that of corruption and extortion
is open to the official. <i>Il faut bien vivre</i>;
and so long as the old system exists one must
do in Turkey as the rest of the Turks do. It
is utterly corrupt; but it must be reformed
from the top downwards.</p>

<p>People in the East never think of asking
what was the origin of pashas or in what
manner they have attained their high station.
Genealogical trees in Turkey are not cultivated;
most of the old stems (as explained in
Part II., Chap. I.) were uprooted at the beginning
of the present century; their
branches, lopped off and scattered in all directions,
have in some instances taken fresh
root and started into a new existence; but
they no longer represent the strength of the
ancient trunk. The important body of beys,
pashas, etc., thus abolished, had to be replaced
by a new body selected without much
scrutiny from the crowd of adventurers who
were always awaiting some turn of fortune
whereby they might be put into some official
position and mend their finances.</p>

<p>Yusbashi A., one of the chief leaders of
the Bashi-Bazouks, who performed the work
of destruction at the beginning of the Bulgarian
troubles, was subsequently sent to Constantinople
by the military authorities to be
hung; but being reprieved and pardoned, he
was promoted to the rank of Pasha. He
had come, when a boy, to the town of T⸺
as an apprentice in a miserable barber’s shop;
later on he left his master and entered the
service of a native bey. During the Crimean
war he joined the Bashi-Bazouks, and when
peace was made returned to the town with
the rank of captain and a certain amount of
money, which he invested in land. By extortion
and oppression of every kind exercised
upon his peasants, he soon became a
person of consequence in the town. Later
on this man found his way to the Konak,
was appointed member of the council, and
was placed upon some commission by which
he was enabled, through a series of illegal
proceedings, to double and triple his fortune
at the expense of the Government revenues.
The misdeeds of this man and some of his
associates becoming too flagrant to be longer
overlooked, the Porte sent a commission to
examine the Government <i>defters</i> or accounts.
The captain, by no means frightened, but
determined to avoid further trouble in the
matter, is said to have set fire to the Konak
in several places, so that all the documents
that would have compromised him were destroyed
and the Pasha and commission who
came to inspect his doings barely escaped
with their lives. Knowing the desperate
character of the man they had to deal with,
they were alarmed, and unfeignedly glad to
get away and hush the matter up.</p>

<p>Thus the illustrious line of Pashas and
Grand Vizirs, like the Kiprilis, was put aside
and replaced by a long list of nonentities
who, with the exception of a few such as
Ali and Fuad Pashas, cannot be said to have
benefited their country in any remarkable degree,
or to have shown any special qualifications
as statesmen.</p>

<p>The title of Grand Vizir, now nominally
abolished, was one of the oldest and the
highest given to a civil functionary. His
appointment, being of a temporal nature, depended
entirely upon the will of the Sultan,
who might at his pleasure load the Vizir
with honors, or relieve him of his head.
This unpleasant uncertainty as to the future
attached to the Vizir’s office gradually almost
disappeared as the Sultans began to recognize
the indispensable services rendered to
them by an able Grand Vizir. They began
to appreciate the comfort of having ministers
to think for them, make laws, and scheme
reforms in their name; and this confidence,
so agreeable to an indolent Sultan, and so
convenient to an irresponsible minister,
was the ruling principle of the constitution
during the reign of Sultan Abdul-Medjid, who
was affable to his ministers, changed them
less frequently than his ancestors did, and
loaded them indiscriminately with decorations
and gifts. Not so his wayward and
capricious brother and successor Abdul-Aziz,
who scrupled not, on the slightest pretext, to
dismiss his Grand Vizir. A trifling change
in his personal appearance, a divergence of
opinion, timidly expressed by the humble
minister—who stood with hands crossed,
dervish-fashion, on his shoulders, in the attitude
of an obedient slave—just as much as a
more serious fault, such as casting difficulties
in the way of his Imperial Majesty with regard
to his exorbitant demands on the treasury,
were sufficient to seal the fate of the
daring <i>Sadrazam</i>. But in spite of the difficulties
and drawbacks and humiliations of
the post, a Grand Vizir continued to be, after
the Sultan, the most influential person in the
country. The gates of his Konak were at
once thrown open, and the other ministers
and functionaries flocked to pay their respects
to him. The governors of districts
telegraphed their felicitations, while the ante-chamber
and courts of his house and office
were rarely free from the presence of a regular
army of office-hunters, petitioners, dervishes,
old women, and beggars, waiting for
an audience or a chance glimpse of the minister
on his exit, when each individual pressed
forward to bring his or her claim to his notice.
<i>Pek aye, bakalum olour</i>,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> were the
words that generally dropped from the
mouths even of the least amiable Vizirs on
such occasions—words of hope that were
eagerly caught by the interested parties, as
well as by the numerous <i>cortége</i> of <i>kyatibs</i>,
servants, and favorites of the great man who,
according to the importance of the affairs or
the station of the applicant, willingly undertook
to be the advocate of the cause, guaranteeing
its success by the counter-guarantee
of receiving the <i>rushvets</i> or bribes needed in
all stages of the affair. This method of
transacting business, very general in Turkey,
is called <i>hatir</i>, or by favor; its extent is
unlimited, and its application varied and undefined;
it can pardon the crime of murder,
imprison an innocent person, liberate a condemned
criminal, take away the property of
one minister to present it to another, remove
governors from their posts just as you change
places in a quadrille, or simply turn out one
set, as in the cotillon, to make room for another.
Anything and everything can in fact
be brought about by this system, except a
divorce when the plea is not brought by the
husband.</p>

<p>I have particularized the Grand Vizir as
doing business in this way merely because it
was he who was more appealed to in this
manner than the other ministers, not because
the others do not follow closely in his steps.
Their duties are extensive and important, and
demand for their proper and exact performance
not only intelligence, but also high
educational qualifications, which, with rare
exceptions, Turkish officials do not possess—a
capital defect, which, added to the uncertainty
of the period they are likely to remain
in office, and the systematic practice, pursued
by each successive minister, of trying
to undo what his predecessor had done for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the country, and of dismissing most of the
civil officials and provincial governors to replace
them by some from his own set, greatly
contributes to increase maladministration,
and to create the disorder that has long prevailed
in Turkey.</p>

<p>About honesty I need not speak, for no
business of any kind is undertaken without
bribery; even if the minister should be above
this, there are plenty of people surrounding
him who would not be so scrupulous. Kibrizli
Mehemet Pasha was one of the few high
officials against whom no charge of the kind
could be brought, but his <i>Kavass-Bashi</i> condescended
to take even so small a sum as five
piastres as a bribe. This Pasha was a thorough
gentleman, high-minded both in his
administrative affairs and family life. After
he lost his position as Grand Vizir, I had occasion
to see a great deal of him; he took
the reverses of fortune with great calmness
and <i>sang-froid</i>; so do all Turks meet “the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.”</p>

<p>The fall of a minister was generally rumored
some time before it took place, during
which period he and those around him tried
to make the most of the opportunities left to
them, while the opposition continued their
intrigues until the blow finally fell. When
this happened the <i>Sadrazam</i> remained at
home, the gates of his Konak were closed,
and the world, including his best friends,
would pass without venturing to enter; the
only visitors would be his banker, doctor,
and creditors, who in prosperity and adversity
never neglect this duty.</p>

<p>During the administration of a Grand Vizir,
his harem was also called upon to play
its part and take the lead in the female society
of Stamboul. The <i>salon</i> of the chief
wife, like that of her husband, would be
thrown open, and crowds of visitors, including
the wives of the other ministers, would arrive
to offer their respects and felicitations, and
demand favors and promotions for their sons
or posts for their husbands. All these visitors,
on their arrival, were ushered into the
ante-chamber according to their respective
stations, where they took off their <i>feridjés</i> and
refreshed themselves with sweets, coffee,
sherbets, etc. The interval between this and
their reception, sometimes of several hours’
duration, was spent in conversation among
the visitors, in which some of the ladies of
the household, or some visitors staying in
the house, would join, until they were requested
to proceed to the drawing-room.
When the hostess appeared all would rise
from their seats, walk towards the door,
make <i>temenlas</i> and deep obeisances, and endeavor
to kiss her foot or the hem of her
garment, an act of homage which she would
accept, but gracefully and with much dignity
try to prevent in those of high rank by saying
<i>Istafourla</i> (Excuse me—don’t do it). The
conversation, started afresh, would depend
for subjects upon the disposition and tact of
the mistress of the house; but would chiefly
consist in flattery and adulation, carried
sometimes to a ridiculous extent. The manner
of the <i>hanoum effendi</i> would be smooth
and friendly towards the partisans of her
husband, curt towards those of the opposition,
but patronizing and protecting in its
general tone towards all. Should the Vizir’s
lady be of the unprincipled type, the conversation
would bear a different <i>cachet</i>. I was
told by some distinguished Turkish ladies
that when they paid a visit to the wife of a
short-lived Vizir, the lady, both old and ugly,
entertained them with a recital of the follies
and weaknesses of her husband and exposed
some of her own not more select proceedings
into the bargain.</p>

<p>The wife of a Grand Vizir also played a
great part with regard to the changes, appointments,
and dismissions which followed
each new Vizirate, by the influence she exercised
both over him and also in high quarters,
where she often found means to make
herself as influential as at home.</p>

<p>I have often been asked what a Turkish
lady does all day long? Does she sleep or eat
sugar-plums, and is she kept under lock and
key by a Blue-Beard of a husband, who allows
her only the liberty of waiting upon him?
A Turkish lady is certainly shut up in a
harem, and there can be no doubt that she is
at liberty to indulge in the above-mentioned
luxuries, should she feel so disposed; she has
possibly, at times, to submit to being locked
up, but the key is applied to the outer gates,
and is left in the keeping of the friendly
eunuch. Besides, woman is said to have a
will of her own, and “where there is a will
there is a way” is a proverb to which Turkish
ladies are no strangers. I have seldom
met with one who did not make use of her
liberty; in one sense she may not have so
much freedom as Englishwomen have, but in
many others she possesses more. In her
home she is perfect mistress of her time and
of her property, which she can dispose of as
she thinks proper. Should she have cause
of complaint against any one, she is allowed
to be very open spoken, holds her ground,
and fights her own battles with astonishing
coolness and decision.</p>

<p>Turkish ladies appreciate to the full as
much as their husbands the virtues of the
indispensable cup of coffee and cigarette;
this is their first item in the day’s programme.
The <i>hanoums</i> may next take a bath; the
young ladies wash at the <i>abtest</i> hours; the
slaves when they can find time. The <i>hanoum</i>
will then attend to her husband’s wants,
bring him his pipe and coffee, his slippers
and pelisse. While smoking he will sit on
the sofa, whilst his wife occupies a lower
position near him, and the slaves roll up the
bedding from the floor. If the gentleman be
a government functionary the official bag
will be brought in, and he will look over his
documents, examining some, affixing his seal
to others, saying a few words in the intervals
to his wife, who always addresses him
in a ceremonious manner with great deference
and respect. The children will then
trot in in their <i>gedjliks</i> with the hair uncombed,
to be caressed, and ask for money
with which to buy sweets and cakes. The
custom of giving pence to children daily is
so prevalent that it is practised even by the
poor.</p>

<p>The children, after an irregular breakfast,
are sent to school or allowed to roam about
the house; the <i>effendi</i> proceeds to perform
his out-of-door toilet and leaves the <i>haremlik</i>,
when the female portion of the establishment,
freed from the pleasure or obligation
of attending to his wants, begin the day’s occupation.
If this should include any special
or unusual household work, such as preserve-making,
washing or ironing, or general
house-cleaning, the lady, be she of the
highest position, will take part in it with the
slaves. This is certainly not necessary, for
she has plenty of menials, but is done
in order to fill up the day, many hours of
which necessarily hang heavily on her hands
when not enlivened by visiting or being visited.
In the capital, however, less of this
kind of employment is indulged in by the
fashionable <i>hanoums</i>, who are trying to create
a taste for European occupations by
learning music, foreign languages, and fine
needlework. The time for dressing is irregular.
A lady may think proper to do her
hair and make herself tidy for luncheon, or
she may remain in her <i>gedjlik</i> and slippers all
day. This fashion of receiving visitors <i>en
négligé</i> is not considered at all peculiar unless
the visit has been announced beforehand.</p>

<p>Visiting and promenading, the principal
amusements of Turkish ladies, are both
affairs of very great importance. Permission
has previously to be asked from the husband,
who, if liberally disposed, freely grants it;
but if jealous and strict, he will disapprove
of seeing his family often out of doors.
When a walk or drive is projected the children
all begin to clamor to go with their
mother. Scarcely is this question settled by
coaxing or giving them money, than another
arises as to which of the slaves are to be allowed
to go. Tears, prayers, and even little
quarrels and disturbances follow, until the
mistress finally selects her party. The details
of the toilette are very numerous; the
face has to be blanched, then rouged, the
eyebrows and lashes to be blackened with
<i>surmé</i>, and a variety of other little coquetries
resorted to requiring time and patience before
the final adjustment of the <i>yashmak</i> and
<i>feridgé</i>.</p>

<p>Then comes the scramble for places in the
carriage, the <i>hanoums</i> naturally seat themselves
first, the rest squeeze themselves in,
and sit upon each other’s knees. It is wonderful
to see how well they manage this close
packing, and how long they can endure the
uncomfortable postures in which they are
fixed.</p>

<p>If the excursion is solely for visiting, the
occupants of the carriages make the best of
the time and liberty by coquetting with the
grooms and <i>agas</i> in attendance, should these
be young and handsome, and sending salaams
to the passers-by, mingled with laughter
and frolic. But when the excursion has a
picnic in prospective, or a long drive into the
country, the gayety and fun indulged in is
bewildering; and the <i>hanoums</i> can only be
compared to a flock of strange birds suddenly
let loose from their cages, not knowing what
to make of their new freedom. Flirting,
smoking, eating fruits and sweets, walking
about, running, or lounging on the carpets
they bring with them, varied by music and
singing, fill the day. They usually set out
early and return before sunset in time to receive
their master on his visit to the harem
before dinner. When this meal is over, the
company, comfortably dressed in their <i>négligé</i>
costume, indulge in coffee and cigarettes,
and the events of the day are discussed.
The ladies then retire to rest at an early hour,
and rise the next day to go through the same
routine.</p>

<p>At the foot of the imperial throne we see
the princes, who, like children at dessert, are
to be seen, not heard. They now enjoy a
degree of freedom before unknown, and their
wants and caprices are to a certain extent
satisfied by allowances from the Sultan. In
childhood and youth they are masters of
their own time, and employ it as they please.
On emerging from boyhood they are furnished
with harems; some more distantly
related to the reigning Sultan are allowed to
have children; but the others are denied that
privilege. All these members of the imperial
family live a very secluded life. They
are not allowed to take any part in the administrative,
hold commissions in the army
or navy, or enter the civil service. The only
exception to this rule was the son of the late
Sultan Abdul-Aziz, who, at the age of ten,
was, I believe, a captain in the army, and a
few years later was made a general. This is
said to have given the occasion for a reproach
made to the prince by his father, who at the
moment of his deposition turned to him and
said, “My son, I placed you in the military
school where you remained three years without
making a single friend; see what this
has now led to!”</p>

<p>This reproach of being friendless addressed
to any of the princes is unjust, as
they are not allowed to make friendships.
Friends for a prince mean a party, and a
party means cabals and conspiracies, so all
such dangerous connections are carefully
suppressed, and the prince, under the influence
of the suspicion and espionage by which
he is surrounded, is as little disposed to have
any friends among the influential classes and
men of rank as they are to court his friendship
or approach him too closely. A personal
friend of the ex-Sultan Murad told me
that in early youth that prince and he had
been very much thrown together, and a sincere
affection had sprung up between them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
which, however, on Sultan Abdul-Medjid’s
death, had to be entirely given up. Rare
meetings between them could only be arranged
when the prince went to Pera on
shopping expeditions. Thus the Ottoman
princes, spoilt in childhood, secluded from
active public life, are left to vegetate in their
respective homes.</p>

<p>The Princes of the Blood and all relations
of the late Sultan used always to be cleared
out of the way on the accession of a new
Padishah; but the custom has fallen into
disuse since the time of Mahmoud II., who
found it necessary to order the strangulation
of the deposed Sultan, the drowning in sacks
of 174 of his wives and odalisks, and also the
decapitation of a great number of other persons.
This measure, considered needful to
insure the inviolability of his person, as the
only remaining representative of the house of
Othman, soon put an end to the rebellion
that had occasioned his ascension to the
throne. On the day of his proclamation as
Sultan, thirty-three heads were exposed at
the gate of the Seraglio to bear evidence to
the fact. Rebellion, fire, and murder, it
was said, could not be otherwise put down
than by counter-violence, and the extreme
measures adopted by the new sovereign
ended in the restoration of order in the capital.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this black page in the
history of Mahmoud, this Sultan, to whom
history has not yet done justice, was one of
the best, most enlightened, and powerful of
Ottoman sovereigns.</p>

<p>Unlike most of his predecessors, he had
not wasted the long years of captivity in idleness
and frivolous occupations, but had seriously
employed them in study. He originated
the material changes that have since been
made in the life of seraglio inmates, and also
endeavored to better the condition of his
Christian subjects. Whatever progress has
been made by the Turkish Mohammedans
in the road of civilization must also be attributed
to his efforts. Amid wars without and
revolts within, the discontent of the Moslems
at the attempted innovations, the clamoring
of the Christians for the amelioration of their
condition, the Sultan struggled on for thirty
years with a perseverance worthy of the
cause, till death put an end to his work. He
was succeeded by his son, the liberal but
weak-minded Abdul-Medjid.</p>

<p>The young Sultan was well imbued with
the ideas of his father, but less capable of
carrying them out; yet he showed himself
liberal and sincerely desirous of improving
the degraded condition into which the country
had fallen.</p>

<p>The security of life and property became
greater under his rule. Executions and confiscation
of property became less frequent,
and a general change for the better in the
material existence of the people was decreed;
but unfortunately the Sultan could not insure
the carrying out of his decrees. The exchequer,
impoverished by the extravagance
of the palace and the corruption of the officials,
was on the brink of bankruptcy, which
was only postponed by the foreign loans obtained
in the succeeding reign.</p>

<p>Had the Sultan’s perseverance in seeing
these changes enforced been equal to his
good-will in ordaining them, Turkey might
have been spared many of its present miseries.</p>

<p>He was beloved by his subjects, who, in
the midst of their misery, forgave his weakness
in remembering his gentleness and benevolence
to those who appealed to his mercy.
His aversion to bloodshed was so great that
he was never known to decree a single execution.
This was, of course, a serious hindrance
to carrying on the judicial arrangements
of the country. In cases of urgent
necessity his signature had to be obtained
by subterfuge.</p>

<p>A lover of pleasure and ease, Abdul-Medjid,
on coming to the throne, soon plunged
into that life of self-indulgence, luxury, and
excess, which at once began to tell upon
his delicate constitution and by degrees affected
in a most fatal manner his moral and
physical faculties; and he died of exhaustion
on June 25th, 1861.</p>

<p>His successor, Abdul-Aziz, had been the
first to profit by the indulgence and liberality
of his brother, who from the beginning to the
end of his reign showed him genuine brotherly
affection, allowed him uncontrolled freedom
as heir-apparent, and furnished him with a
very liberal income, making a point of never
getting any object of value for himself,
without offering its equivalent to his brother.</p>

<p>Abdul-Aziz, however, did not make any
good use of the liberty he enjoyed before
coming to the throne. Sensual, extravagant,
and narrow-minded, his occupations and
pleasures were anything but imperial: his
wasteful habits were ruinous to his country,
whilst his want of judgment and foresight
prevented his realizing the fatal effects of his
conduct. This may, however, be accounted
for, to a great extent, by the fact that he was
subject at times to <i>merak</i> (aberration of
mind). From an early age he began to give
signs of that whimsical, suspicious, and
morose disposition which during the latter
part of his reign became the principal characteristic
of his nature.</p>

<p>Unlike his brother, Abdul-Medjid, he was
strongly built, and his personal appearance
was singularly unattractive. His tastes and
amusements, very much in harmony with his
exterior, showed themselves in all kinds of
extravagant and odd fancies. Cock-fighting
was a spectacle in which he greatly delighted,
by turns decorating or exiling the combatants.</p>

<p>In his moments of good-humor he often
imposed a wrestling match upon his ministers
and favorites, at times taking an active
part in the sport. The celebrated Nevrez
Pasha, half knave, half fool, who from the
lowest stage of seraglio functions had been
raised to a ministerial position, was the one
generally chosen by the Sultan with whom
to measure his strength.</p>

<p>The corpulent Pasha never failed to be the
beaten party; the ludicrous attitudes into
which he fell and his jokes gave him a
higher grade whenever they were called into
play, and caused him to say that every kick
he received from the imperial foot was worth
to him a <i>Nishan</i> (a decoration), a konak, or
a vizirlik.</p>

<p>It would, however, be unfair not to acknowledge
in this Sultan some good services
rendered to his country.</p>

<p>One of these is the purchase of the fine fleet
of iron-clads the Porte now possesses; another,
his untiring efforts in placing the army
on the, comparatively speaking, improved
and high footing on which it stood at the
beginning of the war; and a third, the construction
of the railways now existing in the
country. Some will perhaps reckon among
his merits the shrewdness he and his ministers
displayed in accomplishing these undertakings
with funds that were not exactly
theirs.</p>

<p>The details of the dethronement, short captivity
and death of Sultan Abdul-Aziz, though
extremely curious and interesting, are as yet
but little known to the public. One of the
ladies of his seraglio related some of the incidents
connected with these events to me, but
she said, “We cannot now divulge all, for
fear of prejudicing the living, but in course
of time, when history reveals unknown
facts, all doubts and mystery on his untimely
death will be removed.” Upon which she
burst into tears, and repeatedly uttered the
Turkish exclamation of distress, “Aman!
Aman!”</p>

<p>She then recited to me in Arabic the verse
which the unfortunate Sultan, on entering
his prison, traced on the dust that covered
the table. The following is a translation:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Man’s destiny is Allah’s will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sceptres and power are His alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My fate is written on my brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lowly I bend before His Throne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning towards the window the Sultan
noticed that one of his much-prized iron-clads
had been placed in front of the <i>Yahli</i> which
served as his prison, with the guns pointed
towards him. But a still more appalling sight
met his gaze. A sailor was seized by a few
of his comrades, who, pointing him out to
the Sultan, passed a crimson <i>kushak</i> or girdle
round his neck and led him three times round
the deck, signifying to the unfortunate captive
that in three days he would undergo the
same operation. Pointing this out to the
Validé Sultana, he exclaimed, with emotion,
“Mother! see to what use the force I have
created for the preservation and aggrandizement
of my empire is applied! This is evidently
the death reserved for me.” A belt
containing some of the most valuable crown-jewels,
which the Sultan had placed on his
person when leaving the palace, disappeared
the day he was found dead, and has never
since been heard of. The Sultan had to ask
for food repeatedly before he was supplied
with it, and even then what he obtained was
given him on the <i>sofra</i> of a common soldier.
On my further questioning this lady on the
cause of the Sultan’s untimely end, she
passed her hand over her lips, meaning they
were sealed, and muttering a “<i>Turbé Istafourla</i>,”
said, “It is not in my power to reveal
more!—the justification of the dead
must be withheld so long as it endangers the
living. The duty of the devoted is to keep
silence until history can divulge secrets that
will then harm none.”</p>

<p>Soon after the death of Abdul-Aziz, I had
occasion to discuss it with a Turkish general.
Expressing his opinion of the equally unfortunate
Sultan Murad, the Pasha, with smiling
urbanity, said, “I cannot tell as yet; but
with us, Sultans are now so numerous, that
we can afford to sweep them away successively
with a broom, if they do not suit us.”</p>

<p>Every one is acquainted with the quiet
and peaceable manner in which Sultan Abdul-Aziz
was dethroned in 1876, to make room
for his nephew Murad. This unfortunate
prince was as little acquainted with the
changes that were being planned as was his
uncle, and his sensitive nature, unprepared
for the shock that placed him on the throne,
caused him to receive the messenger who
came to inform him of the change in his position
more as the bearer of his sentence to
death than the herald of sovereignty. Taken
by surprise at the moment he was about to
retire, the prince hastily put on his coat and
met the vizir at the door of the Mabeyn.
Deathly pale, but calm and resigned, he
looked in his face, and said, “What is my
offence, and whom have I ever harmed that
I should thus be doomed to an untimely
death?”</p>

<p>Entirely ignorant of the conspiracy that
opened a path for him to the throne, and
severely grieved for his uncle’s misfortunes,
the news of his tragical end is said to have
given the first shock to the young sovereign’s
intellect, and, followed by the murder
of the ministers, with its equally distressing
details, determined the bent of his vacillating
mind. One of the first symptoms of his
insanity was a habit he fell into of spanning
with his hand the distance between the wrist
and elbow joint, striking the bend of the arm
with his hand, then starting, and reflecting.
I have never heard of his having broken out
into acts of violence, except upon one occasion,
when he raised a stick and struck his
brother-in-law. On one occasion he made
his escape into the garden, where he was
found sitting on a marble slab, making grimaces
at those who approached him. He is
said to have experienced some lucid intervals;
one of these chanced to be at the moment
the salutes were being fired on the occasion
of his brother Abdul-Hamid’s ascension<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to the throne. Looking at his son, a
promising youth of fourteen, he said, “My
boy, what is the reason of this firing?”
“Oh!” said the boy, wishing to spare his
father’s feelings, “it is the fête of a foreign
monarch.” “No,” said the unhappy monarch,
“it is the proclamation of my own dethronement,
and the accession of thy uncle
to the throne; God’s will be done!” Heaving
a deep sigh, he shed a few tears, and,
happily for him, under the circumstances,
relapsed into his former state.</p>

<p>Sultan Murad was said to possess many of
the virtues of his father, a kind and gentle
disposition, and intelligence and liberality of
ideas. During his short reign, the affability
of his manners, and the desire he showed to
please all parties, irrespective of race or religion,
and to abolish the burdens that
weighed upon them, had gained for him the
respect and affection of his subjects, which is
evinced even to the present day by sorrow
and sympathy for his misfortunes.</p>

<p>The present Sultan at first declined the imperial
throne, from feelings of affection and
delicacy towards his brother, and could only
be prevailed upon to accept it when all the
physicians, called in for advice, pronounced
Murad’s case quite hopeless. Sultan Abdul-Hamid
is much esteemed and highly spoken
of by persons who have had the honor of
conversing with his Imperial Majesty. He
is, moreover, said to be qualified for his position,
being liberal in his ideas, and possessed
of many of the qualities of a good sovereign,
and desirous of carrying out the reforms
that alone can insure the happiness of
his people and restore prosperity to the country.
Unfortunately, he came to the throne
at a moment when the best and most gifted
of sovereigns could do little single-handed.
When affairs are settled, much will naturally
be expected from him, which his friends and
the well-wishers of Turkey feel confident he
will realize.</p>

<p>I have not yet mentioned an important section
of the Turkish community—the slaves.
Slavery in Turkey is now reduced mainly to
one sex. Male slaves, except in the capacity
of eunuchs, are now rare, though every now
and then a cargo of them is smuggled into
some port and privately disposed of, since the
Government professes to share the anti-slavery
views of England. But female slavery
is a necessary part of the seraglio and of the
Turkish harem system. The seraglio is of
course recruited from its numbers; and few
Turks can afford to keep more than one free
wife. A second wife insists upon a separate
establishment, and causes endless jealousy to
the first wife and trouble to the husband.
But a slave is no cause of jealousy, lives in
the same house as the wife, and costs much
less to keep than a free woman. Female
slaves, too, are generally given by fathers to
their sons, to avoid the expense of a marriage;
and daughters, on marrying, are always
supplied with a slave as lady’s-maid.
Moreover, slaves are in much request as servants,
and do their work excellently, besides
presenting many advantages and conveniences
that are not found in free women.</p>

<p>The condition of slaves in Turkey is not a
hard one. The principle is of course radically
wrong, and the initial stage is full of
cruelty. But the women are not often ill-treated;
and when an occasional case of violence
and ill-usage occurs, it excites general
indignation among the Moslems. A slave is
entitled to her liberty after seven years of
bondage, and she generally gets it, and is
dowered and married to a freeman, though
sometimes a bad master will evade the law
by selling her before the seven years have
quite expired. But this is a rare case, and
the slave system in Turkey is, as a whole, a
widely different thing from American slavery.</p>

<p>The only class who suffer much are the negresses.
When they are freed and married off
it not seldom happens that from their native
wildness or other causes they quarrel with
their husbands and are turned off to earn their
own living as best they may. Their condition
then becomes very wretched, and the quarter
in which they live is a dismal group of
rickety houses, inhabited by a miserable and
ragged set of women and children. This is
by no means the case with the Abyssinians
or the half-castes, who rank higher, and
never have to appeal to public charity. But
the negresses are hardly worse off than the
disabled slaves. If a woman of this class by
some accident or age becomes unfit for work,
she is looked upon as a burden and very
badly cared for.</p>

<p>Turkish slavery is not so bad as it might
be: the system is softened by many humane
laws, and is marked by a kindly paternal
character. Yet it is a blot on the country,
and so soon as the harem system and polygamy
can be got rid of, it too must go.</p>

<p>There are few nations that can compete
with the Armenians in historical misery.
Tossed about between Arsacid, Roman, and
Sassanian; fought over by Persian and Byzantine;
a common prey to Arabs, Mongols,
and Turk, it is a matter for amazement that
the nation still exists at all. Up to the fourteenth
century the Armenians held persistently
to their country; but after its subjection
by the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt, the
unfortunate inhabitants, seeing no hope of
the restoration of their old independence, and
despairing of relief from the oppression and
spoiling to which they had been exposed for
centuries, began to migrate to other countries,
to try whether fortune would everywhere
be so unkind to them. Some went to
Anatolia, others to Egypt, or to Constantinople,
where they were kindly received and
allowed a Patriarch. Some wandered into
Poland, whence they were soon driven out by
the determined hostility of the Jesuits, and
forced to take refuge in Russia, where they
were joined by numbers of their compatriots
and formed a colony at Grigoripol. Others
went to the Crimea and Astrachan, and many
of the Armenians who had first gone to Turkey
followed in their steps. The Armenians
in Russia were treated with great kindness
by Peter the Great and Catherine, and were
granted special rights and privileges. A colony
of Armenians was settled at New Nakhitchevan
on the Don. After more persecutions
from the Ottomans, in the sixteenth
century, a large number of Armenian refugees
set out for Persia. The Shah received
them graciously, and settled them in Ispahan.
Afterwards, during the war between the
Shah and the Sultan, a depopulation of Armenia
was attempted, with the view of destroying
the Turkish power there. Twelve
thousand families were dragged off to Persia,
most of whom died on the way. The
settlers at Ispahan were at first treated well,
but afterwards subjected to such persecution
that they were obliged to seek a home in
other lands. The portion of Armenia ceded
by Persia to Russia, thus acquiring for the
first time the necessary conditions of peace
and safety, became the refuge of the Armenians
who had not already left their native
land, but who now, driven beyond endurance
by the oppressive rule of the Pashas, crossed
the frontier and immediately found themselves
possessed of the ordinary privileges of
Russian subjects, and able to carry on commercial
pursuits, in which the nation excels,
in peace and confidence. Thus the Armenian
race became scattered over the face of
the earth, whilst only a remnant still lives in
the land of its ancestors. The Armenians
are to be met with all over the East. There
are large numbers of them at Constantinople
and a few other towns, such as Adrianople,
Gallipoli, and Rodosto. In the towns of the
interior, however, their number is small.</p>

<p>Ages of Asiatic oppression, varied by few
glimpses of prosperity, in the traditional garden
of Eden, have obliterated whatever love
the Armenians formerly had for their country,
which they willingly deserted to seek a
home wherever they could find one. When
the first cravings of their hearts for peace and
security had been satisfied, they settled down
in communities, forgot their country and its
past history, and assimilated their external
forms and customs with those of the nations
among whom they lived, with the philosophic
<i>nonchalance</i> of the Asiatic. In Armenia,
the people who remain, remembering
the terrible sufferings their country has gone
through, have followed the wise policy of
burying in the depths of their hearts any surviving
sparks of patriotism or love of liberty;
though these hidden sparks may some day
be fanned into flame by the introduction of
education and by the influence Russia is exerting
in the country. So far the Porte may
felicitate itself on the success its foreign policy
has met with in Armenia. This policy,
with its consequences of misery and suffering,
is safe only so long as ignorance and stupid
docility prevail among the masses; this cannot
last forever, and in the face of present
events it will not be surprising to hear of
troubles breaking out in that direction as well
as everywhere else. It is only a question
of time. In Turkey, political feeling among
the Armenians is still in its infancy; but
there must be thinking men among the educated
young generation who are watchful of
the present and hopeful for the future.</p>

<p>The Armenians as a race are strong, well
built, and hardy. With these constitutional
advantages they readily take to the mechanical
arts; but commerce and banking are
their <i>forte</i>, and in these they show great ability
and as much honesty as is possible in a
country where, of all difficulties, that of following
a straight line of conduct is the greatest.
They are considered crafty, but at the
same time exercise considerable moral influence
in the countries they inhabit, especially
at Constantinople, where some of the rich
Armenians have been very closely connected
with the high dignities of the empire. Their
fancy for toad-eating is well adapted to
please the Turks, who by turns show them
regard and contempt. There is an old saying,
that no Turk can be happy in the evening
without having cracked a few jokes with
an Armenian during the day.</p>

<p>The physiognomy of the Armenians is
generally dark. Their heads are large, with
black, coarse, and abundant hair. Their
eyes, overshadowed by long eyelashes and
thick eyebrows, meeting over the nose, are
black and almond-shaped, but lack the lustre
of Greek eyes. The nose, the worst feature
of the Armenian face, is large and hooked;
the mouth large, with thick lips; the chin
prominent. Their bearing would be dignified
but for a certain want of grace. Armenians
are divided into two classes denominated
<i>Kalun</i> and <i>Injé</i>, or coarse and refined.
The latter belong to the Roman Catholic
creed, and are certainly more advanced than
the former, who are far more subservient to
the Turks, and keep as much as possible in
the background, devoting themselves to the
interests of the Porte in general and to their
own in particular.</p>

<p>In Armenia the ladies are secluded to the
extent of dining and sitting apart from the
men, and are said to be very backward in
every respect. Their costume very nearly
resembles that formerly worn by Turkish
women. They display the same disregard
to neatness as the latter, without possessing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
their redeeming point of cleanliness: their
heads are specially neglected, and abound in
live stock of a most migratory character. My
mother once pointed out one of these creatures
on the forehead of an Armenian girl, and
reprimanded her for her neglect of her person;
the girl answered that she did not know
that any human being could exist without
them!</p>

<p>The Armenian ladies of Constantinople are
renowned for their beauty, which is supposed
to lie particularly in the languid expression of
their eyes. Both in Constantinople and Smyrna
there are many Armenians of both sexes
who are well educated, and scarcely to be
distinguished from Europeans in society. I
was once invited to an Armenian fancy ball,
where I was the only European present.
Everything was arranged as in civilized society,
the stewards were equal to their duties,
and the costumes were <i>recherchés</i> and varied.
One slight pretty girl, in particular, dressed
in the old Turkish costume, produced a great
sensation, and was deservingly besieged by
partners, for she waltzed to perfection.
Many of the ladies and gentlemen spoke English,
and nearly all French, and I certainly
spent a very pleasant evening among them.</p>

<p>In the privacy of their homes the women,
as a rule, are untidy and slatternly. They
are exceedingly fond of dress, and, to the
best of their ability, copy the Parisian
fashions; but their natural want of taste seldom
fails to make itself evident in toilettes
of glaring and ill-assorted colors, while their
hands, arms, and necks are overloaded with
jewelry. Out of doors they are shod with
boots of Parisian manufacture, on whose
high heels they totter along the badly-paved
streets; but they exchange them for slippers
down at heel on re-entering their homes.
Even those who have lived in Europe, and
no longer consider themselves Orientals, sit
cross-legged on their sofas in the most careless
costumes.</p>

<p>The Armenians have advanced but a very
little way on the road of education. The
most enlightened are certainly those in British
India, whilst those of them who are Russian
subjects have of late considerably improved.
Hitherto, the nation has never had
a fair chance, but that it has the possibility
of progress in it is shown by the fact that no
sooner are the Armenians placed under a firm
and wise government than they at once begin
to go forwards, in every respect. The progress
of the inhabitants of Russian Armenia
has begun to work a political revival among
their brethren under Turkish rule. A wish
for instruction is everywhere beginning to be
shown, and it has received a strong and most
salutary impulse from the numerous American
missionaries now established throughout
Armenia. The untiring efforts of these
praiseworthy and accomplished workers in
the cause of civilization and humanity are
beginning to bear fruit, especially since education
has become one of their principal objects.
They are working wonders among
the uncultivated inhabitants of this hitherto
unhappy country, where mission-schools,
founded in all directions, are doing the double
service of instructing the people by their
enlightened moral and religious teaching, and
of stimulating among the wealthy a spirit of
rivalry, which leads them to see their own
ignorance and superstitious debasement, and
raises a desire to do for themselves, by the
establishment of Armenian schools, what
American philanthropy has so nobly begun
to do for them.</p>

<p>The moral influence that America is now
exercising in the East through the quiet but
dignified and determined policy of its Legation
at Constantinople, curiously free from
political intrigues and rivalry, is daily increasing,
and has the most salutary effect on
the country. It watches with a jealous care
over the rights and safety of the missionaries,
who are loved and respected wherever they
settle, and make their influence felt in the
remotest corners of Turkey. Next to Greece,
whose educational efforts are naturally greater
throughout the country, it is America that
will be entitled to the gratitude of the Christians
for her ready aid in elevating the ignorant
masses to the dignity of civilized beings.</p>

<p>In the Armenian schools, the Turkish,
Armenian, and French languages are taught;
the two former are generally well mastered
by the pupils, Armenians being considered
apt linguists; a very fair knowledge of
French is also common among them.</p>

<p>Armenians do not show any taste for the
arts and sciences. One seldom hears of an
Armenian artist, doctor, or lawyer, and the
few that do exist attain only mediocrity.</p>

<p>It is difficult to obtain correct statistical information
of native Armenian schools, but I
can affirm that of late years they have greatly
increased in number, and are much improved
in their organization and mode of teaching.
At Constantinople, Erzeroum, and many
other towns where the Armenian communities
are large, excellent schools for girls have
been founded. In towns where these are
wanting, many girls are sent for a few years
to the boys’ schools, where religion, reading,
and writing are taught them. Turkish, the
language with which the Armenians are
most conversant, is also taught from books
written in the Armenian characters. In
all other respects, the education of Armenian
girls is very much neglected; from an early
age they fall into a listless, aimless existence,
and are seldom taught to busy themselves
with needlework or any useful or rational
employment. Some of the wealthy families
at Constantinople and Smyrna are manifesting
a desire for improvement in this respect,
by engaging European governesses or sending
their children to European schools; but
it will be long before either sex gets rid of
the ignorance and indolence which circumstances,
perhaps, as much as nature, have
forced upon it.</p>

<p>The Jews dwelling in Turkey are, to a
great extent, descendants of those expelled
from Spain by the Inquisition and the edict
of 1492; their language is a corrupt Spanish
dialect; but they are conversant with those
of the places they inhabit. Besides these and
other native Jews, there is an influential class
of European Jews who are certainly in the
van of progress among their co-religionists
in Turkey. They are educated, liberal-minded
men, and, as a rule, a prosperous
class. They are untiring in their efforts to
develop education among the native Jews
by establishing schools, assisting the poor,
and setting a good example of conduct by
their own higher manner of life.</p>

<p>The native Jews may be divided into two
classes, Conservative and Progressive. The
Conservative Jews are strict, rigid, and intolerant
to their brethren: they keep aloof from
the rest of the world, and mix with it only
in business transactions. They are cunning
and avaricious, and although some possess
large fortunes, they are seldom known to use
them for the benefit of the community, or
for any other good purpose. Strongly opposed
to liberal education, the influence they
exercise over their respective communities is
always employed to counteract the action of
the enlightened party. The Progressive
Jews, who are becoming pretty numerous
among the upper classes, act in direct opposition
to these principles and endeavor as
much as possible to shake off old customs and
traditions.</p>

<p>The chief occupations of the Jewish community
are banking and commerce. They
excel in both to such a degree that where a
man belonging to another nationality can
only realize a fair competence, the Israelite
makes a fortune; whilst in positions in which
other men would starve, the Jew will manage
to keep himself and family in comfort.
The secret of this well-known fact lies in the
unusual finesse and ability displayed by
Israelites occupying high positions in the
business world, and the cunning and ingenuity
of the lower orders, who with moderate
exertion make the most of their trade, and
extort all they can from those with whom
they have dealings.</p>

<p>With regard to moral and personal qualifications,
the Jews of Turkey are the most
backward and debased of any of the races.
This degenerate condition may be attributed
to more than one cause. One of the chief
causes, however, is the general feeling of
antipathy shown towards Jews in a semi-civilized
country: all kinds of real and fictitious
sins are attributed to them, from the
charge of kidnapping children (an absurdity
still credited everywhere in Turkey) to the
proverbial accusation of never transacting
business with members of other creeds without
infringing the laws of good faith and
honesty. To apply this latter charge to the
whole community would be unjust, for there
are honest, liberal, and straightforward men;
but there is no doubt the reputation is not
altogether ill-earned among them.</p>

<p>The Jews in Turkey have from all times
shown a greater liking for their Moslem
neighbors than for the Christians. The
Moslems sneer at them and treat them with
disrespect as a nation, but are far more tolerant
and lenient towards them than towards
the Christians. The Jews, on their side,
although at heart feeling no disposition to respect
their Mohammedan masters, show great
sympathy outwardly for them; and in case
of a dispute between Christians and Mohammedans,
unanimously espouse the cause of the
latter. The wealthy Israelites would render
every assistance in their power to remove the
difficulties of the Government, while those
of humbler standing tender their service for
the performance of anything that may be
required of them, however degrading.</p>

<p>In few countries is the contrast of wealth
and indigence among the Jews so striking as
in Turkey. On one side may be seen wealth so
great as to command respect for its possessors,
and give them an influence in the localities
in which they spring up greater than that
of all other nationalities; whilst hard by one
sees poverty and wretchedness of the most
sickening nature. The principal cause of
this is the limited sphere of action allotted
to, or rather adopted by, the Jewish communities.
They evince a strong repugnance
to going beyond the few trades generally
practised by the laboring classes; the rest
content themselves with performing the
coarsest and dirtiest work of the town.
From generation to generation the Jews will
cling to these callings without allowing themselves
to be tempted beyond them, or raising
themselves in the social scale by taking to
agricultural or other pursuits that might insure
them a comfortable home and an honorable
living.</p>

<p>In towns where the Jewish element predominates,
it is packed in dingy, crowded
quarters, in hovels, buried in filth. These
miserable abodes contrast strongly with the
fine and showy houses of the rich. Both rich
and poor of the native Jews may be seen in
their court-yards or at their doors, the mother
rocking the cradle, the children playing in
the mud, and the women and girls washing
or engaged in other household occupations.
The men on coming home don their <i>négligé</i>
in-door costume and join the family party,
lounging on a sofa, smoking and chatting.
This community is very noisy, the most natural
conversation among them being carried
on in the loud tones of lively dispute, all talking
at once in such an elevated key as to be
heard at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>They are certainly lively and cheerful,
neither want nor poverty detaining them at
recreation-time from listening to their discordant
national music, which they accompany
by a vocal performance of a deafening
nature.</p>

<p>Some of the women are very pretty, and
their beauty is heightened by their peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
costume and gay head-dress. They are, however,
cold and rather graceless in demeanor,
and are not noted for intelligence.</p>

<p>Education among the native Jews was completely
neglected until very recently, when
the efforts of the European Jews and a few
of the liberal natives finally produced a beneficial
reaction, and schools of a superior order,
principally dependencies of “L’Alliance
Israélite” formed in Europe for the benefit of
the Eastern Jews, have been established in
all the principal towns, and are said to have
greatly benefited the rising generation, which
is wanting neither in intelligence nor aptitude
for study. Before the establishment of
these schools the Jews had to send their children
to European or Greek schools, where
they received an indifferent style of education,
as the training, owing to the difference
of religion and habits, did not include the
complete course.</p>

<p>The director of the schools established by
“L’Alliance Israélite” gave me most satisfactory
accounts of the progress made by the
pupils attending them, and of the increase of
morality among them. The Jewish girls
have not equal advantages with the boys with
respect to educational establishments. This
unfortunate difference will, it is hoped, be in
time remedied by the schools, founded by the
same society and others, in the principal
towns. All these schools owe their origin to
the generosity of wealthy Israelites like
Baron Hirsh and others, who have endowed
the establishments with the funds necessary
for rendering them useful and of lasting duration.
In Salonika the girls’ school, established
some years ago, has, thanks to the able
management and munificence of the Messrs.
Allatini, been placed upon an excellent footing,
and, being presided over by the most intelligent
and gifted European ladies of the
community, is doing great and good service.</p>

<p>Besides these schools, there is one of older
standing connected with the Missionary Society,
under the direction of a missionary and
three able and devoted Scottish ladies, who
receive a large class of day pupils and give
them the benefit of sound education for a
trifling fee. This part of missionary work is
in reality the best and most beneficial to the
community, and far more so than the efforts
made at proselytism—efforts which, so far
as I can ascertain, have nowhere met with
success.</p>

<p>Polygamy is prohibited among the Jews;
but their divorce laws are very lenient; and
a separation is the easiest thing in the world—for
the husband. A wife cannot get a
separation without her husband’s consent.
Practically, however, this is seldom refused
if a sum of money is offered. A gentleman,
aware of this Jewish weakness, and falling in
love with a Syrian beauty who was married
to a Jew, bought her divorce for 2,000<i>l.</i> In
some towns the morality of the community
is closely watched. In Adrianople, for instance,
a faithless wife is led for three successive
days round the Jewish quarter, and
compelled to stop before every door to be
spat upon and abused. At Salonika, where
the Jews are very numerous, it is quite otherwise.
Among the wealthy and liberal many
of the old customs have been set aside, intermarriage
with European Jewish families
is of frequent occurrence, and many modifications
permitted which do not seem strictly
conformed to the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>The affairs of the Jewish communities, like
those of the Christians, are managed by
elders. The chief Rabbi has control over
all matters regarding the religious and social
interests, and is in direct communication
with his superior at Constantinople.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1864 Russia, the present champion of
the subject races of Turkey, was busy in her
own vast dominions giving the <i>coup de grâce</i>
to the unruly and only half-subjugated Circassians.
These people, during a period of
eighty years, resisted Russian aggression, defending
their homes and liberties at the point
of the sword, until the consequences of war,
famine, and misery compelled them to yield
to the superior power of the Czar. They
were offered the choice of migrating to the
lower steppes of that land, where Russian
discipline alone could tame them, or of quitting
the country. Some accepted the former
alternative, while a large portion, consisting
of about 300,000 souls, preferred to accept the
hospitality of Turkey. Before leaving the
shores of their beloved native land, collected
on the beach like a herd of wild animals
caught in a storm, they raised their voices
and cried aloud against the injustice and
cruelty they, with their wives and children,
had received at the hands of the Muscovites.
That voice reached Turkey, who, whatever
her sins are, has never been known to refuse
shelter and assistance to the homeless and
the refugee. A proof of this may be found
in the harbor offered within my recollection
to the exiled Prince of Persia, Kouli Mirza,
subsequently a pensioner of Great Britain;
the famous Syrian chieftain, the Emir Beshir
and his party; the Polish, Wallachian, and
Hungarian refugees, and Abdul Kadir; the
Algerine captive chief, who obtained permission
from Napoleon to reside in Turkey. All
these with their followers were received with
hospitality, treated with kindness, and, in
some cases, allowed pensions while they remained
in the country.</p>

<p>This gift of Russia to Turkey was, as far
as the female portion of it was concerned, as
irresistible as the beauteous Pandora is said to
have been to Epimetheus; and the Circassian
ladies certainly brought with them the equivalent
for Pandora’s famous box, in the shape
of their kith and kin, who dispersed themselves
all over the country, and, from that moment,
have never ceased to do mischief, and justify
Russia’s treatment of them. I have had opportunities
of seeing these people since their
arrival in Turkey, of watching them in the
different stages through which they have
passed, and noting the irreparable harm they
have done to the country that offered them
an asylum. On landing, about 2000 were
quartered in a little wood. Emaciated by
the long sufferings of the journey, covered
with vermin, and half famished, they encamped
on the damp soil in the early spring,
some sheltering themselves under the trees,
others under such tattered tents as they possessed,
all closely packed together, the sick
lying face to face with the dead, and the living
moving, gaunt and ghostlike, among
them, careless of everything except, getting
money. As we neared the infected camp,
bands of men and women came forward,
holding their children by the hand and offering
to sell them to any who would buy. The
little wretches themselves seemed anxious to
be separated from their unnatural parents, in
the hope of getting food and better shelter.
These Circassians were divided into two
classes, the chieftains and the slaves. Each
regarded the other with distrust; the one expecting
from his slave the abject obedience
he had been accustomed to receive in his native
land; the other, aware of the change in
his condition, ready to dispute this right with
his former master.</p>

<p>Rations and clothes were distributed by the
Turkish authorities, but the master took his
slave’s portion and sold it for profit. The
slave, on his side, stole what he could, and
stripped even the dead of his last covering,
leaving the corpse to be devoured by dogs.
The sight of these bodies by the townspeople
and others originated the idea that these
people were cannibals, and this reputation
preceding the Circassians, on their march
further into the country, caused a panic on
their route. Children ran away on their approach,
and even the peasants themselves, instinctively
aware of the pernicious nature of
the element introduced among them, did their
best to avoid giving them offence in refusing
assistance.</p>

<p>The majority of the Circassians distributed
in European Turkey are settled in the Dobrudcha;
the rest were allotted patches of ground
in all parts of Bulgaria and in other provinces,
where the peasants were called upon to
supplement the Government in providing
them with cattle, grain, and all other requisites
necessary to start them as settlers. The
Bulgarian peasants stoically made it a point
of duty to render every assistance in their
power to the destitute and helpless creatures
so strangely brought among them, and Circassian
settlements soon started up like weeds
by the side of the peaceful and thriving villages.</p>

<p>Four years later I had again occasion to
pass through these settlements, and was
much surprised at the transformation in the
appearance of the Circassians. The men,
dressed in their picturesque costume, wearing
their arms, some of which were curious
and rich pieces of Eastern workmanship,
were lazily lounging about the commons of
their villages; while the women, arrayed in
their dress of red silk braided with gold, presided
over their household duties. Some
well-conditioned cattle, driven by Circassian
youths, were grazing in the surrounding
meadows. I stopped at a Bulgarian village
opposite one of these settlements. It was a
<i>prasnik</i>, or feast-day, and the Bulgarian youth
and beauty, dressed in their best, were dancing
the <i>hora</i>. As our party approached, the
dance stopped, and the women, saluting me
with a cheerful smile, regarded me with great
curiosity. The headman of the village came
forward, and, with a hearty welcome, offered
me hospitality for the night. I had a long
and interesting conversation with him and
the elders of the little community upon the
Circassian settlements. The Bulgarian peasants
even at that early date had a long list of
grievances against their new neighbors.
Pointing to the opposite village, they assured
me that its very foundation and prosperity
was due to Bulgarian labor and money.
“The Circassians,” said they, “lounge
about the whole day, as you see them doing
now. Their industry does not extend beyond
the sowing of a few bushels of millet for the
use of their families. Their cattle, as well as
most of their belongings, are not for work,
but are stolen property that they are freely
allowed to appropriate to themselves to the
prejudice of the peasants.” The poor men
seemed much concerned at this new evil that
had befallen them. “We never get redress
for the wrongs done by our neighbors,” said
they; “and if the Government functionaries
continue to disregard our complaints, and
to allow the depredations of these marauders
to go unpunished as they have hitherto done,
not only our property but our lives will be at
their mercy.”</p>

<p>A Circassian girl from the village on seeing
me came forward, and with tears in her
eyes implored me to take her with me and
keep her in my service. She was about
eighteen years of age, a beautiful creature,
dark complexioned, with sparkling eyes,
which overflowed when I refused her request.
“I am perishing with <i>ennui</i> here,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
“in this dreadful outlandish place, without a
hope or chance of getting away by being
sold or rescued by some charitable person
who might take me to Stamboul!” Surprised
at her statement, I asked why she did
not do as others of her nation, and insist upon
being sold. With a look of hopeless despondency
she replied: “None now dares to
buy the <i>Cherkess</i> girls belonging to the emigrants.”
She would give me no further information,
but through subsequent inquiry I
learnt that the Turkish Government, among
the laws it had made relating to the Circassians,
had deprived them of the right of selling
their children as they formerly did in
their native country, and had also decreed
the liberation of the slaves held by them. But
this law, like many others, was disregarded,
and the chieftains continued to treat their
subjects as slaves, a cause of constant quarrelling
and bloodshed among them. Some
broke out into open rebellion and refused to
obey their master as such, while the chiefs,
strong in the close alliance that existed among
them, could at all times, notwithstanding
the interference of the authorities, bring
their subjects to terms by taking the law into
their own hands.</p>

<p>With regard to selling their children, it was
neither the law prohibiting the practice nor
the want of purchasers that put a stop to it,
but the abuse made of it by the Circassians
themselves. For instance, two brothers
would agree to sell a sister to some Mohammedan,
who, after having paid the money
and obtained possession of the girl, was suddenly
called before the local courts to answer
the charge brought by her father, without
whose consent it was pretended the daughter
had been ravished and illegally sold. The
purchaser thus losing his prize without receiving
back the money he had paid to the
dishonest Circassians, and being condemned
for the proceeding by the law, made known
the undesirability of such purchases among
his friends, and deprived them of any wish
to participate in such troublesome business.</p>

<p>The depredations of the Circassians became
so extensive that from one farm alone in the
district of Adrianople three hundred and fifty
head of cattle were stolen and never recovered.</p>

<p>A systematic company of cattle-stealers
was established all over Bulgaria; the stolen
animals taken from the villages found their
way to Rodosto and Gallipoli, where they
were shipped to Asia Minor and exchanged
with stolen cattle from that coast. The dexterity
with which a Circassian, introducing
himself into a stud, takes possession of the
best horse is the terror and wonder of the
farmer. He uses a kind of lasso which, cast
over the head of the animal, enables him to
mount it and stick to it as if horse and rider
were one. The wildest animal is soon cowed
under the iron sway of the rider, and disappears,
to be seen no more.</p>

<p>A gentleman, wishing to procure a good
horse from a Circassian, asked the owner if
the animal was a good trotter. The Circassian,
with a malicious smile, answered, “Sir,
he will take you to the world’s end, so long
as you are careful not to turn his head in the
direction of Philippopolis, but in that case I
do not guarantee him!”</p>

<p>Another incident, illustrative of the thievish
propensities of these people, was related
to me of a carter who, driving his wagon
from town, fell asleep in it, and was met by a
band of Circassians, who thought the prize
too tempting to be allowed to escape. Some
of the party, therefore, took to unharnessing
the oxen, and two of them, taking the place
of the captured animals, kept the cart going
while the others went off with the oxen.
When these were at a fair distance, their
substitutes gave the cart a strong jerk to
arouse the poor unsuspecting driver, and
heartily saluting him, disappeared across
country.</p>

<p>So long as Circassian marauding was limited
to incidents of this nature the peasants
put up with it, and in many cases abstained
even from complaining to the authorities;
but gradually the proceedings of this dangerous
race assumed a character the gravity of
which only escaped public notice because of
the general disorganization that followed.</p>

<p>Becoming prosperous and wealthy through
their continual depredations and robberies,
the youthful portion of the community that
had escaped sickness on first landing formed
a lawless hostile faction in the land, having
as little respect for the authority of the Porte
as for the life and property of the natives.
When the Government tried some years ago
to bring a portion of them under military
discipline, they rebelled and gave much
trouble to the authorities in the capital itself,
where it was found necessary to seize, exile,
and otherwise punish some of the chiefs for
insubordination.</p>

<p>I happened to be travelling in a Turkish
steamer with thirty of these rebellious subjects.
Their chief was said to have been an
influential person, holding the rank of aide-de-camp
to a member of the Imperial family,
perhaps the famous Cherkess Hasan, who
nearly two years ago murdered the Ministers.
The Turkish officer who had charge of these
troublesome prisoners told me that for two
months he and his men had given chase to
this band, who had escaped into Asia Minor,
where they had continued their depredations,
and were only secured at last by being surrounded
in a forest. They appeared a dreadful
set of cut-throats—not at all pleasant fellow-passengers—and
their guards had to keep
good watch over them. This officer further
stated that the Sultan, out of kindness, had
invited them into his dominions, giving them
land, and every opportunity of settling down
and becoming useful members of society;
but it was a sad mistake, for they would
neither work nor yield to discipline, neither
would they make any efforts to requite the
Government for the benefit they had received,
but in every instance proved their reputation
for lawlessness and depredation. It is an
important fact that before the Bulgarian
troubles the peasants of the districts where
the Circassians were in force dared no longer
circulate except in companies of fifty or sixty,
and that murderous attacks had become
every-day occurrences.</p>

<p>Although protected in some high quarters
in consequence of their close connection
through family ties, the Circassians are generally
disliked and distrusted, especially by
the people, who have no such strong reasons
for protecting them. In physical features
they often present splendid specimens of the
famed Circassian type, though not unfrequently
bearing a great resemblance to the
Mongolian. In manner they are haughty and
even insulting, with an air of disdain and
braggadocio such as no really brave man assumes.
In character the Cherkess is undoubtedly
cowardly, cruel, and false. Education
he has none, so that all the evil passions
of his nature, unchecked by any notion
of moral, religious, or civil obligation, have
developed themselves with irresistible force,
and prompted him to acts that during the last
two years have placed the name of the Circassian
below that of the gypsy.</p>

<p>It is said that they are to be expelled from
European Turkey. If this is the case, the
unfortunate population of Asia Minor, both
Mohammedan and Christian, among whom
they will be quartered, are most deeply to be
pitied, as well as the Government, whose
duty it will be to re-establish and discipline
these ruffians now rendered desperate and
doubly hardened by the crimes and horrors
of every description into which they have
lately plunged with impunity.</p>

<p>The best and wisest plan would be to request
Russia, if she really and earnestly desires
the welfare of the Christians in Turkey,
to take the Circassians back and reinstate
them in their native land. Should this be
impracticable, the Turkish Government
would do well to send them to colonize some
of the fertile but waste lands in the heart of
Asia Minor, in the vicinity of half-savage
tribes like themselves, in whom they might
find their match, and cease to become a perpetual
source of trouble and injury both to
the Government and its peaceful subjects.</p>

<p class="tb">The migration of the Tatars into Turkey
preceded that of the Circassians by half a
century. When their country passed into
the hands of Russia, the Tatars, unwilling to
remain under her dominion, removed, at a
great sacrifice of life and property, into Bessarabia,
where, scarcely had they begun to
feel settled and to forget their wrongs and
sufferings, than the Muscovite eagle again
clouded the horizon, and the emigrants, fluttering
at its approach like a flock of frightened
birds, collected their families and belongings,
and took to flight. Weary and
exhausted, they alighted on the Ottoman
soil, and settled in the Dobrudcha. They
were a quiet and industrious people, and before
long, through toil and exertion, they
made themselves homes, and peopled the
Dobrudcha with their increasing numbers.
Some of the Tatar princes migrated with
their subjects, and took up their abode in
the vicinity of Zaghra, where they retained
their title of <i>Sultanlar</i>, or “the princes.”
They became in time wealthy landowners,
but, unlike their less exalted brethren, they
were hard, unjust, and oppressive masters to
the Bulgarian peasants, and by their cruel
treatment of these people were among the
causes of their being cited as rebels before
the authorities.</p>

<p>A second emigration of Tatars took place
after the Crimean War, when these unfortunate
people, in a similar plight to the Circassians,
came to join their kinsmen in the
Dobrudcha and other parts of European Turkey.
They were poor, and for the most part
destitute of every requisite of life. The
Turkish Government did its best to help them
by giving grants of land, etc., but those who
settled as agriculturists were unfortunate, for
a series of bad seasons crushed their first
efforts, and, unassisted by further relief, they
remained in a stationary condition of poverty,
notwithstanding many praiseworthy
efforts to better their condition. Those who
settled in towns fared better; all who were
acquainted with some handicraft at once set
to work and executed their different branches
of industry with so much activity, neatness,
and honesty that they soon reached prosperity
and comfort.</p>

<p>Their religion is Mohammedan, but they
are by no means strict or fanatical. Their
women do not cover their faces when among
their own community, but when abroad are
veiled like the Turkish women. They are
very thrifty in their habits, and some are
pretty and sweet-looking, but as a rule they
are the dirtiest subjects in the Sultan’s dominions.
Their uncleanliness with regard to
dress, dwellings, and food is so great as to
shock and horrify the Turks, who certainly
have that virtue which is said to come next
to godliness.</p>

<p>The principal ingredient in their cookery
seems to be tallow; as candle-makers they
are greatly superior to the natives, and the
preference given to this article of their manufacture
has induced them to take the principal
portion of this branch of industry into
their hands.</p>

<p>When a colony settled in the town of
A⸺, one of my friends took a great interest
in the efforts made by these estimable
artisans to earn a livelihood as shoe-makers,
tailors, tallow-chandlers, etc. Some opened
small shops for the sale of different articles,
while those who had no distinct calling or
possessed no capital became wood-cutters, or
hawkers of vegetables, fruits, etc. In this
business, however, they met with shrewd
and knowing professionals—the Jews, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
were far more able and practised hands at it,
and at first gave very little chance to the
poor Tatars. It became a race between Jew
and Tatar who should get up earliest in the
morning and go furthest to meet the peasants
bringing their produce to market. In this
the Tatar was most successful, as he was the
better walker of the two, and less afraid than
the Jew of venturing some distance from the
town; but the latter contented himself with
the reflection that there are many roads that
lead to the same goal, and many ways of
making profit which are not dreamt of in
Tatar philosophy.</p>

<p class="tb">The Gypsies in Turkey, numbering about
200,000 souls, profess outwardly Mohammedanism,
but keep so few of its tenets that
the true believers, holding them in execration,
deny their right to worship in the
mosques or bury their dead in the same cemetery.
Although not persecuted, the antipathy
and disdain felt for them evinces itself
in many ways, and appears to be founded
upon a strange legend current in the country.
This legend says that when the gypsy nation
were driven out of their country and arrived
at Mekran, they constructed a wonderful
machine, to which a wheel was attached.
Nobody appeared able to turn this wheel till,
in the midst of their vain efforts, some evil
spirit presented himself under the disguise of
a sage and informed the chief (whose name
was Chen) that the wheel would be made to
turn only when he had married his sister
Guin. The chief accepted the advice, the
wheel turned round, and the name of the
tribe after this incident became that of the
combined names of the brother and sister,
<i>Chenguin</i>, the appellation of all the gypsies of
Turkey at the present day.</p>

<p>This unnatural marriage, coming to the
knowledge of one of the Moslem saints, was
forthwith, together with the whole tribe,
soundly cursed; they were placed beyond
the pale of mankind, and sent out of the
country under the following malediction:
“May you never more enter or belong to the
seventy-seven and a half races that people
the earth, but as outcasts be scattered to the
four corners of the earth, homeless, wretched,
and poor; ever wandering and toiling,
never realizing wealth, enjoying the fruits of
your labor, or acquiring the esteem of mankind!”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I have related this legend because it represents
in a very striking manner the condition
of the gypsies of Turkey as well as the belief
placed in it by people of all creeds, who not
only put them beyond the pale of humankind,
but also deny to them what would be
granted to animals—their alms. Last year
during the Ramazan, a popular Hodja,
preaching on charity to a large congregation
of Mohammedans, thus addressed them—“O
true believers, open your purses every one of
you, and give largely to the poor and needy!
Refuse not charity either to Mohammedans or
Christians, for they are separated from us
only by the thickness of the skin of an onion,
but give none to the Chenguins, lest part of
the curse that rests upon their heads should
fall upon yours!”</p>

<p>Mohammedanism and the Christian rites
also practised by a few of the gypsies can
only be a mask to hide the heathen superstition
handed down among them from generation
to generation, together with their native
language, and some other observances, such
as keeping a fire continually burning in their
camp. On the first of May all go in a body
to the sea-coast or the banks of a river, where
they throw water three times on their temples,
invoking the invisible <i>genii loci</i> to grant
their special wishes.</p>

<p>Another custom, observed with equal constancy,
is that of annually drinking some potion,
the secret of whose preparation is
known only to the oldest and wisest of the
tribe. This draught is partaken of by the
whole community as a charm or preventive
against snake-bites. It is certain that, owing
to some agency, the gypsies can catch snakes
and handle them with the greatest impunity,
but are never known to kill or hurt these
animals.</p>

<p>The habits of these people are essentially
nomadic. Sultan Murad IV. tried to check
their roving disposition by ordering that they
should be permanently settled in the vicinity
of the Balkans, and obliged to live a regular
life; but disregarding the imperial decree,
they dispersed all over the country, now
pitching their tents in one place and now in
another, like evil spirits bent on mischief, or
birds of prey ready to pounce upon any game
that offers itself. Their pilfering propensities
are entirely directed to supplying the
common wants of nature; they never grow
rich on their plunder.</p>

<p>The tribe is divided into two classes—those
who live in the towns for short periods,
and those, the wildest and vilest, who
wander about all the year round; during the
summer pitching their tents in the open
country or on the roadside, men, women,
and children all huddled together under the
tattered rags that form their only shelter.
The men and women are miserably clad, and
the children walk about in their original
nakedness. The Chenguins are muscular,
thin, and of middle size; with dark skins,
bright sparkling eyes, low undeveloped
brows, and well-defined nose, wide at the
nostril; the lower part of the face is ill-formed
and sensual. When quite young,
some of the women are very pretty and much
appreciated by the Turkish community as
dancing girls, in which calling their utter
want of decency and morality makes them
adepts. When the gypsy woman is advanced
in years she becomes perfectly hideous; her
brown skin shrivels up through privation
and exposure, her body gets thin and
emaciated, and her uncombed elf locks, half
concealing her features, give her the appearance
of a witch. The cunning creature,
aware of the effect she produces, makes capital
out of it, by impressing the credulous
with a belief in her uncanny powers of predicting
the future, casting or removing the
evil eye, or other magic spells, invoking benefits
or bringing evil upon those who refuse
charity or provoke her anger; thus extorting
from fear the alms that pity refused.</p>

<p>In winter they quarter themselves in the
vicinity of towns or villages, where they
have a better chance of carrying on their
trade of petty thieving. The nuisance they
become to a neighborhood is increased by
the hopelessness of obtaining any recovery of
property stolen by them. The gypsy is by
no means particular as to the nature of the
object he covets, but will condescendingly
possess himself of an old horse found conveniently
in his neighborhood, or venture
further and lay hands on anything from a
useful article of dress to a stray ox.</p>

<p>The following incidents that came under
my personal observation were attributed to
an encampment of gypsies in the vicinity of
the town of M⸺, and will give an idea
how these people, called by the peasants
<i>Taoukjis</i>, set about business, and the precautions
they take to avoid detection and escape
punishment.</p>

<p>In our stable were three fine and valuable
horses, much admired in the town, which
had evidently awakened the cupidity of some
gypsies encamped opposite the house on the
other side of the river. On one occasion,
when the two best were away from home together
with the groom, the third horse disappeared
during the night. In the morning
I sent to give notice of the occurrence to the
sub-governor and request his aid in discovering
the thief or thieves. This functionary,
a kind and civil man, at once called upon me
and gave me the assurance that the horse
would be recovered, as none but the gypsies
encamped opposite could have stolen it. The
police were sent to the camp to request about
a dozen to come to the Konak to answer for
the robbery.</p>

<p>On arriving, the gypsies were placed under
close examination by the Kaimakam and
Medjliss; they naturally denied all knowledge
of the robbery and protested against the
accusation. Finding them obstinate, the
Kaimakam ordered them to be placed under
the pressure of the whip, but this appearing
to produce no effect, made the governor suspect
that some trick had been resorted to, in
order to prevent the culprits feeling the
smart of the punishment they had anticipated.
They were ordered to undress, upon
which, looking very crestfallen, they began
to pray for mercy, but their prayers were
soon drowned in the sounds of general hilarity
that followed the discovery of the successive
layers of sheepskin in which they had
taken the precaution of enveloping their
bodies. The first few blows that fell upon their
now unprotected backs, drew forth screams
of “Aman, Effendi!” followed by sundry
revelations on the disappearance of the horse.
“Last night,” said one, “it came quite unexpectedly
into our camp; we tried to secure
it but it escaped again, we will endeavor to
find and bring it back, but, oh, Aman! Effendi!
beat us no more! we will pay the value
of the horse for the honor of the Chenguin
tribe!” When these proceedings came to
my knowledge, I begged the Kaimakam not
to be too hard on the poor rogues, but set
them free after the severe punishment they
had received. I may add that the horse was
never found.</p>

<p>On the shapeless, ill-paved, mud-pooled
space which usually occupies the centre of
small Turkish towns, the peasants collect
from all parts of the surrounding country
with their carts and beasts of burden, laden
with goods for sale or barter. On one occasion
an industrious Bulgarian cloth-weaver
took up his habitual post at the corner of a
narrow street, where he exhibited his stock
of goods and invited purchasers. Shortly
afterwards, a ragged, thievish-looking Chenguin,
with a couple of sieves of his own
manufacture, came and seated himself opposite,
apparently with the object of selling his
stock in trade. No customer appeared, and
the gypsy began to show signs of weariness
and sleepiness; he yawned desperately,
stretched his limbs, looked at his neighbor,
yawned again and again, until he succeeded
in infecting him with a sympathetic drowsiness.
Gradually passing into the second
stage of somnolence, he closed his eyes and
nodded. The Bulgarian, following his example,
was soon fast asleep, and the gypsy,
quickly springing to his feet, seized a fine
piece of <i>shayak</i>, and walked away with it.
The Bulgarian unsuspectingly slept on until
roused by his head coming in contact with
the wall, against which he was leaning; his
bewildered gaze instinctively turned to the
spot which the other slumberer had occupied,
and, finding that it was empty, he
looked at his merchandise and discovered
that his best piece of cloth had disappeared
also. Much troubled, he packed up the rest
of his goods, and proceeded to the house of
the Chorbadji, who advised him to find the
gypsy, and point him out to the police, who
might succeed in recovering his property.
To this he responded, “All the gypsies have
the same wild, tattered, and cunning appearance,
and follow the trade of <i>taoukjis</i>; if I
call the attention of the police to my case, I
shall be made responsible for the imprisonment
of the whole band, and incur expenses
greater than the value of my cloth. I must
therefore forego it; but never again shall this
stupid ‘Bulgarski glava’ be outdone by
gypsy cunning!”</p>

<p>The other callings followed by the Chenguins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
are those of tinkers, blacksmiths, leaders
of bears and monkeys, and musicians of
a primitive kind. The women keep up the
<i>Nautch</i> dance of the East with an excruciating
kind of accompaniment, consisting of a
drum, bagpipe, tambourine, and pipe, with
which they make the round of the towns and
villages on feast-days, when they are hired
by the people, and dance and shout to their
hearts’ content.</p>

<p>The gypsies are idle, false, and treacherous.
They have none of the manly virtues; and
on account of their known cowardice, they
were never pressed into military service by
the Turks until last year, when a certain
number of those settled in towns and villages
were sent off as recruits. It was a picture
worth seeing, when a band of these wild
creatures was embarked at the town of S⸺.
Guarded by a detachment of soldiers headed
by a drum and clarionet, and followed by the
whole tribe of old men, women, and children,
screaming, crying, and dragging their
rags after them, these doubtful warriors
marched through the town. I asked an old
crone how it was that the Chenguins had to
go to war. “God knows,” was her reply;
“it is the Sultan’s command and must be
obeyed.”</p>

<p>The hatred shown by the Turks to the invaders
of their country was so great, and their
patriotism and bravery in defending her so
conspicuous, that even this degenerate race
became infected with a certain degree of the
same devotion, and evinced a desire to go and
fight for Allah and the Sultan, although at the
last moment their natural cowardice proved
too strong for them. Some mutilated their
hands, others feigned sickness or insanity as
an excuse for remaining behind, whilst those
who actually reached the seat of war gave
great trouble to their officers, did no service
whatever, and deserted whenever a chance
presented itself.</p>

<p>The class of gypsies living in towns is
slightly better and more respectable as a
community. They generally occupy hovels
built round a court, in which they take shelter
during the night; but during the day, in
winter or summer, they live out of doors. A
great part of their time is spent lounging
about the court, hammering at their forges,
smoking or quarrelling, while the girls listlessly
parade the streets, and the children
beg or fall into any mischief that presents itself.
They are never sent to school, and I
do not think there is a single person of either
sex who is able to write a word of any language.</p>

<p>The gypsies settled in the villages take to
field work as far as their roving habits
and thievish propensities allow them. These
are either <i>chiftjis</i>, who work regularly, or
<i>ailikjis</i>, who do odd jobs. They present
a strong contrast to the rest of the rural
population in their thriftlessness and want
of care for the morrow. They are so careless
of health that an aged gypsy is rarely
met with. As laborers they are very unsatisfactory,
and require much supervision from
their employers. No gypsy ever becomes
wealthy or respectable; as a class they are
always in debt.</p>

<p>The whole tribe is a curious mixture of the
human and the animal: it is endowed with
the scent of the dog, the cunning of the monkey,
and the form and vices, but none of the
virtues apparently, of mankind.</p>

</div>

<p>Regarded from a conveyancer’s point of
view, land in Turkey is of three kinds: <i>mevkoufé</i>
(or <i>vakouf</i>), “church” property; <i>mirié</i>,
crown property; and <i>mulk</i> or <i>memlouké</i>, freehold.</p>

<p>1. <i>Vakouf</i> lands are those set aside for the
support of the religious establishments, the
mosques, <i>medressés</i> (or mosque-colleges) and
other religious schools, and the <i>imarets</i>, or institutions
for public almsgiving. The appropriation
of a just part of a man’s wealth for
purposes of religion and charity is one of the
most constantly reiterated principles of Islam,
and, to the credit of Moslems be it said, it is
a principle very regularly reduced to practice.
It is not surprising, therefore, that on
the conquest of European Turkey a large
share of land was set apart “for God.” But
this original grant was not the only source of
the present large extent of vakouf lands.
Private munificence has constantly added to
the original foundation. The piety of some
Moslems and the vain-glory of others has
ever been displayed in the erection and endowment
of mosques, with their attendant
medressés and imarets. In the one case it was
a sure key to heaven; in the other, it was
the best way to get the praises of men of
one’s own generation and the admiration of
posterity. Formerly ordinary people used
frequently to indulge in this architectural
luxury; but, during the present century,
only Sultans and Grand Vizirs have found
the practice convenient.</p>

<p>Besides the original grant and the private
additions which each century contributed, vakouf
lands have been greatly increased from
a third source. The people of Turkey seem
to have duly appreciated those privileges
against which our own mortmain laws were
directed. The parallel is not indeed strictly
accurate, but there are strong points of resemblance.
A Moslem (or, for that matter, a
Christian) sells his land to a mosque for
about one-tenth of its real value. The land
is now the property of the mosque, but the
seller has the right of lease, and may retain
his tenancy on payment of a fixed rent. During
his life he may sell the lease, or at his
death it passes on to his heirs; but in default
of direct descendants the lease reverts absolutely
to the mosque.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> By this transaction
both parties are the gainers, and only the
Government and its corrupt officials the
losers.</p>

<p>The mosque receives a large interest for a
comparatively trifling expenditure of capital;
and has besides the reversion in the
event of default of heirs. The tenant, though
he has to pay a rent where formerly he paid
none, is not burdened by this slight charge,
and sets against it the immense privileges he
has acquired; for, as a tenant on vakouf land—that
is, holding direct of Allah—he pays
no taxes; he is safe from confiscation by
the Government, extortion from its officials,
and persecution from private creditors. It
is the most profitable and secure tenure to be
met with in Turkey, and it is a matter of
congratulation that the mosque authorities
place so high a value upon money that they
are willing to accept it even from dogs of
Christians who wish to avail themselves of
the protection afforded by vakouf leasehold.</p>

<p>No official report of the extent of the vakouf
lands has, so far as I can learn, been
published; but it is easy to understand that
their extent and value must be very great. It
is even estimated at two-thirds of the whole
land of Turkey. It is therefore remarkable
that the revenues derived from them do not
nearly suffice for the purposes for which they
were intended. The expense of maintaining
the services of the mosques and of keeping
up the extremely economical system of religious
education would not seem to be excessive,
though the charitable imarets would of
course require considerable support. But
these are not the real reasons why these rich
revenues are not sufficient. One reason is,
that they are expected to maintain a large
class of Ulema, whose numbers are altogether
disproportionate to the educational results
they produce. The other and far more disastrous
cause is that the revenues are corruptly
administered.</p>

<p>At first the management of the funds lay
in the hands of agents appointed by the pious
founders. When an agent died, his successor
was named by the Roumeli Kadisi (or
Anadoli Kadisi if in Asiatic Turkey). The
agents were under the supervision of inspectors,
whose business it was to verify the
mosque accounts. These inspectorships
were generally given to high functionaries of
the Porte, and so lucrative were they that
they excited keen competition (in the Turkish
sense), and eventually came to be regarded
as the fixed appendages of certain offices. It
may easily be imagined that between the
agents and the inspectors there was not much
of the vakouf revenues left for the right purposes.
As a matter of fact, most of the
money found its way into the pockets of the
inspectors of the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p>Among the many schemes that engaged
the attention of the Reformer-Sultan Mahmoud
there was of course a place for vakouf
reform. He wished to amalgamate the vakouf
lands with the mirié or crown lands,
but had not the boldness necessary to the
carrying out of so revolutionary a measure.
He contented himself with clearing away
some of the more obvious abuses of the administration
of vakoufs, and appointed a director,
with the rank of Minister, to see to the
proper management of the property. Still,
however, the revenues did not prove sufficient.
The annual budget of vakouf returns
reached a total of 20,000,000 piastres; yet in
1863 it had to be supplemented by another
20,000,000 piastres from the Treasury, and is
ever in need of similar assistance. The
funds are still misapplied; and, as the result,
the mosques and medressés have fallen more
and more into ruin and decay; the imarets
are become instruments of a merely nominal
almsgiving; and every charitable or religious
intention of the pious founders is daily
trodden under foot.</p>

<p>Among the minor objects of vakouf endowments
are the construction and maintenance
in repair of aqueducts and road fountains.
I have often witnessed with regret
the manner in which the trust is abused by
its holders. In most towns the principal
water supply is endowed by vakoufs, the
revenues of which were intended to defray
all expenses connected with keeping the
channels and fountains in repair. In three
cases out of four these funds are misapplied.
At Salonika, for instance, the water supply
is richly endowed, and the town ought clearly
to be well furnished with water. Instead
of this, a great number of the fountains are
dried up, and a serious waste of water is
caused by the neglect of the water-pipes. It
is painful to see the crowd of miserable Jewish
children waiting for hours round the
dribbling fountain under a burning summer
sun, or pierced with the biting winter winds,
till they get a chance of filling their pitchers—too
often only to get them broken in the
battle that immediately ensues. In summer,
when the want of water is most severely felt,
many people do not scruple to dig down
to the water pipes in some deserted street,
stop the current that leads to the fountain,
and thus obtain the supply they
need. In former times fountains were erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
on all the main roads and in every
town and village; but most of them are
now dried up or fallen to ruin. Some of
those that remain are of solid marble, with a
carved frontage inscribed with the name of
the donor, the date of erection, and some
verses from the Koran. Some are in the
form of basins, with jets playing in them,
sheltered sometimes by little kiosks, and always
shaded by fine old trees. The thirsty
traveller and his beast are all the more grateful
when they do find a fountain with water
running, because the chances are so overwhelmingly
against such good luck—thanks
to the vakouf administrators, who from this
point of view deserve credit for intensifying
the virtue of gratitude.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Mirié</i>, or crown-lands, include the
private demesnes of the Sultan and the royal
family, the lands reserved for the partial support
of the administration, the waste lands,
together with an enormous extent of land
originally granted on condition of military
service to the most zealous supporters of the
Sultan, with a view to retaining their fidelity
and assuring the supremacy of the Government
over the native princes. The country
was thus given over to the power and license
of an army of occupation. It was divided
into sandjaks governed by Pashas, Beys,
and Beglerbeys. Those last-named were the
administrators of the sandjaks. Their duty
it was to collect the taxes and furnish the
contingents of troops to the Imperial army.
The favored officers of the Porte received immense
grants of land in return for their zeal;
they were exempt from taxation, and only
required to find soldiers for the wars of the
Porte. Excluding vakouf lands, the greater
part of Turkey was thus placed on a sort of
feudal tenure, the proprietor holding of the
crown by military service. All the evil
effects of the system soon developed themselves.</p>

<p>The lands of these military proprietors
were of course chiefly tilled by the rayahs,
who had formerly held them in freehold.
Although these underholdings were supposed,
like all mirié lands, to be registered,
and thus to enjoy the advantage of a legally
fixed rent, they were yet subject to the endless
extortions invariably associated with the
notion of Turkish officials. Especially heavily
did this system press upon the Christian
tenants of the military landowners. In
principle the conduct of the Turks to their
Christian subjects was not greatly blamable;
it was in practice, as usual, that the
grievances arose. The Christian communities
were managed by their Kodja-Bashi, or
headman, who had to collect the tribute, proportioning
it to the means of each individual;
and to gather the kharadj, or poll-tax,
and other impositions. A community was
allowed to compound for each or all its taxes
by a fixed sum. Thus far all appears surprisingly
satisfactory. But when the actual
condition of the Christian tenants is looked
into, a very different impression is produced.
Their landlords were ever devising some new
extortion; the taxes were levied with ruinous
irregularity; fresh impositions were constantly
being added; and, in fine, their state
became so intolerable that large numbers of
them deserted their faith (of which they are
generally highly tenacious in spite of ignorance
and persecution), and became Moslems,
and were at once placed in possession of the
privileges of the dominant race. A curious
instance of this conversion by necessity was
that of the Krichovalis, a lawless race of
mountaineers about Vodena. About the beginning
of this century they found themselves
unable longer to endure the disabilities
of their condition. They met in solemn assembly
in their old church on a great feast-day,
and swore the sacred oath upon the
Bible that they became Mohammedans under
protest, being compelled to abandon their
faith in order to escape the intolerable trammels
of their bondage. The Bible on which
they swore, containing the signatures of the
chief men, still exists, I am told, in the keeping
of the Greek priest.</p>

<p>The evils of military tenure bore upon the
Porte as well as upon the rayahs. The Sultans
were not slow to note with alarm the
growing power of the great feudatories.
They endeavored to curtail their privileges
and to strengthen the hands of the rayahs
and attach this class to themselves. But for
a long time the efforts of the central government
were unavailing. The military landowners
made common cause with the Beglerbeys,
who had by degrees acquired the supreme
control of their sandjaks; and these
two united in defying the authority of the
sovereign. A great landed aristocracy had
grown up, like the baronage of England in
Angevin times, and threatened the very extinction
of the supremacy of the Porte over
its subjects. A great blow must be struck at
the country Beys; and Mahmoud II. resolved
to strike. He was completely successful, and
left to his successor Abdul-Medjid only the
task of bringing some of the rebellious chieftains
to punishment. Some were beheaded,
other banished, and all had their property
confiscated. Inoffensive tenants by military
service received compensation; but the system
was rooted out, and has now ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>How the great feudal landowners were
crushed will be understood from a few examples.
A short time ago I made the acquaintance
of one of the dervish sheikhs who followed
Ali Pasha when he was dispatched by
Abdul-Medjid to reduce the Bosnian rebels. I
asked how the reduction was effected; and
this was his account: Ali Pasha, with a
small but well-organized army of Nizams, on
approaching the country, asked permission
of the Bosnians to cross into the Austrian
territory. The Bosnians unsuspectingly
granted leave, and we marched into the
country and pitched our camp in its very
heart. After a few days the Pasha produced
the Iradé of the Sultan, containing a demand
for 60,000 recruits from the Bosnians. They
refused to furnish them, and began to assemble
and arm. The Pasha did not insist upon
the enforcement of the Imperial order, but
opened negotiations. He was a wily man and
knew his business. He managed with soft
words and fair promises to entice all the
Bosnian grandees into the camp, under the
pretext of holding a general council. Having
thus collected all the influential persons
of the country, he put them under arrest and
proceeded to try them. Some were beheaded,
and Ali Pasha with his own hand struck
down the leading chief. The rest after some
further parley were brought to terms, and
were then exiled and their goods confiscated.
The 60,000 recruits were soon raised, and
the general marched triumphantly back to
Constantinople at their head.</p>

<p>The Albanian chieftains were dealt with in
the same way: when forced failed, treachery
prevailed. Their two leaders, Veli-bey and
Arslan-bey, were enticed by a friendly invitation
to Monastir, where they were received
with every mark of consideration and kindness.
A few days afterwards they and their
friends were invited to a great feast by Reshid
Mehemet Pasha. This was to take place in a
kiosk outside the town near the head-quarters
of the regular troops.</p>

<p>On the appointed day Veli-bey and Arslan-bey
proceeded to the rendezvous accompanied
by nearly all their beys and retinue; in all
about 400 men. The kiosk was hidden from
view by a turn in the road till they had almost
reached it, and it was only on entering
the space in front that they perceived the
troops ranged in order of battle. A suspicion
crossed the mind of Arslan-bey, who said to
his companion in Eastern phrase, “We have
eaten dirt!” Veli-bey replied, “It is the
regular way of paying honor.” “At all
events,” said Arslan-bey, with doubtful
friendship, “let us change sides.” This
was done, and Arslan-bey found himself
screened from view by the imposing figure
of Veli-bey and his horse. They had
reached the centre of the line, when an order
issued from the window of the kiosk, the
soldiers raised their pieces, and a murderous
fire was opened on the ranks of the Albanians,
followed by a bayonet charge. Veli-bey
and his horse fell pierced with nineteen
balls, but Arslan-bey was unhurt. Followed
by those who had escaped the first discharge,
he turned his horse and took to flight; but a
second fire reached their flank. Arslan-bey
again miraculously escaped, and owing to
the speed of his horse soon left the place of
carnage at a distance. But his flight had
been observed from the kiosk from which
the Grand Vizir had directed the massacre,
and he was pursued; but putting spurs to
his horse, he urged it up the precipitous side
of the hill, making for the summit with furious
speed. The top was almost reached
when a shower of balls brought down man
and horse; and they rolled down the steep
hillside to join the bodies of their fellow-victims
below. Such were the last fatal blows
aimed at the expiring feudal system; exile
and confiscation did the rest.</p>

<p>The once powerful Beys, when thoroughly
crushed and impoverished, were allowed a
small income, and after many years of expatriation
were finally permitted to return to
their native districts. Their power is completely
gone, although their personal influence
is still considerable over the populations
among whom they live, and in the local
courts in which they sit. It is however of a
mutinous nature, and seldom employed either
in facilitating the introduction of the new
measures attempted by the Government for
the improvement of the administration, or in
promoting the general welfare of the country.</p>

<p>Some beys in the interior still possess considerable
landed property, but with few exceptions
their estates are dilapidated and
heavily mortgaged; while their owners are
so deeply in debt to the Government that if
called to a reckoning under a well-regulated
administration they would be ruined men.
A few, however, whose estates are in better
condition are more enlightened, and take a
real interest in the welfare of their country.</p>

<p>The country contains extensive areas of
mirié kinds reclaimed from the waste, for
which of late years there has been a great
demand made by the peasants, who reclaim
portions of them by paying a small fee of
about 1<i>s.</i> an acre. They cultivate or build
upon them, and after paying tithes for the
space of twenty years get the <i>Tapou</i>, or title-deed,
from the Porte constituting them legal
owners. But although subjected to special
laws and restrictions and under government
supervision, it is a dangerous speculation,
often involving litigation, and liable to usurpation.</p>

<p>Great abuses are occasioned by the corruption
of the <i>Tapou Memours</i>, or inspectors, who
within the last seven years have been intrusted
with the supervision and legislation
of such lands, and regulate them (irrespective
of the rights of Christian or Turkish landholders)
in favor of the highest bidder. The
consequences are that many persons have
been dispossessed of their property, others
have had to pay high prices to retain it by
obtaining <i>Tapous</i>, whilst many are daily being
driven out of their lands. An example of
this kind presented itself the other day in the
local court of the town of L⸺. The claimant
was a Turkish <i>Hanoum</i>; the disputants,
Turkish and Christian peasants. The lady,
a widow, had inherited an estate bordering
on some waste land upon which these peasants
had built a village. The <i>Hanoum</i> in the
mean time married an influential person at
Constantinople, through whose authority and
assistance, she managed to obtain a <i>Tapou</i>, including
the village of the settlers on the waste
land within her own property. The villagers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
indignantly protested against this act of usurpation,
and refused to acknowledge the
authority of the lady, who, however, returned,
furnished with powerful <i>Emirnamés</i>
from the Porte to the town of L⸺ to enforce
her claims. The complaints of the
peasants were disregarded, and they themselves
were seized as criminals and brought
to the Konak, driven into it by blows that
fractured the skull of one and occasioned
severe injuries to others, and then imprisoned.</p>

<p>Disputed claims like this on commons,
forests, etc., are innumerable. The estates
sold by the crown also labor under the same
disadvantages. Among many cases I may relate
one in which the purchaser was an English
gentleman who bought a large estate in
Upper Macedonia, comprising one of the
most beautiful lakes in the country. It was
an ancient fief, sold for the sum of 2000<i>l.</i>
The speculation promised to be a splendid
one, and a fortune was expected to be realized.
One day, however, as the owner was walking
over his grounds, an old Turkish peasant
presented himself, and with much natural
eloquence, and perhaps some truth, explained
to the English bey that the former owner had
usurped part of his fields which were comprised
in the estate. The proprietor, either
convinced of the man’s rights, or out of kindness,
ordered that the contested lands should
be restored; but the one individual thus
righted soon developed into a legion, all presenting
equal claims. Subsequently the
legion became a band of armed and menacing
Albanians, who by their hostile attitude
stopped all attempts at culture, and threatened
to shoot the tenants and the steward, burn
the crops, etc. A long litigation followed,
and the affair terminated, after much loss of
time and damages amounting to several thousand
pounds, in the gentleman re-selling the
estate for the amount he had paid for it.</p>

<p>Besides the above-mentioned drawbacks,
the holders of mirié lands cannot sell, transfer,
or mortgage them without a license from
the authorities, nor can they make them
<i>Vakouf</i> property without a special <i>Firman</i>
from the Sultan.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Memlouké</i> or <i>Mulk</i> lands are the
freehold property of their owner, who can do
with them whatsoever pleaseth him well.
They do not form a large proportion of the
lands of Turkey, and a reason for this is the
prejudice entertained against this form of
tenure on account of the difficulties encountered
in establishing titles. It is unfortunately
no unusual thing in Turkey for title-deeds
to be forged, substituted, destroyed,
and otherwise interfered with.</p>

<p>The descent and division of Mirié and Vakouf
lands are regulated by imperial firmans
and the special ordinances of the Vakouf
laws; but Memlouké land comes under the
regulation of the <i>Mehkemé</i> or court of the
town Kadi. The laws of Moslem inheritance
are too complicated to be recorded here, and
their complexity is aggravated by the mixture
of Christians and the different ways of
holding land. In the absence of heirs, mirié
and memlouké lands revert to the state; vakouf,
as already mentioned, to the administration
of pious foundations.</p>

<p>Memlouké land is transferred legally by
conveyance; vakouf and mirié by conveyance
together with registration. The duty
on the sale of memlouké land is five per
cent, and the succession duty two and a
half per cent; on mirié, five per cent on
sale, and the same on succession; on vakouf
land, five per cent on sale, and the same on
succession. A difference, however, is made
if the land is built over.</p>

<p>The division of property among all the
children and the reduction of its value by
these duties tend constantly to the diminution
and deterioration of Turkish estates and
lead generally to mortgage. Mortgage on
landed property is at an average interest of
eighteen per cent. The result is easily imagined.
Freehold lands may be legally mortgaged
before two witnesses without any further
precaution; but crown and “church”
lands to be mortgaged must be registered by
the registrar of title-deeds, or the directors of
vakouf property, for the fee of (nominally)
one per cent.</p>

<p>A great number of large estates can be purchased
in all parts of Turkey for very small
sums. The wealthy native Christians would
gladly purchase these, but for the complications
that surround the possession of landed
property that is not vakouf, and the difficulties
and opposition to which a Christian land-holder
is exposed. Turks seldom look favorably
upon the passing of such estates into
Christian hands. Those who purchase them
are generally foreign subjects; the rayahs
who venture to do so can never enjoy their
acquisitions in the same peace and security.
Among many instances of encroachment on
such estates by hostile beys, Circassians, and
other neighbors, I may mention two that
have come under my personal observation.
The first refers to a wealthy Bulgarian gentleman,
whose acquaintance I made ten years
ago at R⸺. He was a man of great influence,
and a member of the Medjliss, or town
council. A large estate owned by him, not
far from the town, was twice set on fire
by his Mohammedan neighbors, and a large
mill he had constructed was pulled down.
Neither his influence in the district, nor his
wealth, nor his position as member of the
council, could protect his estate, which he
was finally obliged to abandon.</p>

<p>The second case was that of a wealthy
Greek at Baba Eski, a pretty village between
Constantinople and Adrianople. Some years
ago I passed a night in the house of this
Chorbadji. When I talked to him about his
property he complained bitterly of the hostility
he experienced from his Turkish neighbors,
and of the encroachments of the Circassians.
The former had attempted to set
fire to his mill, and the latter had stolen in
the course of one year three hundred and fifty
head of cattle from him. “Wealth and prosperity,”
said he, “are the sure recompense
of every man’s labor in a fine country like
this, but it is hard work to keep them when
acquired.” Last year I met the unfortunate
man at C⸺; he was a complete beggar in
appearance, and, with tears in his eyes, told
me how the Circassians and other enemies,
profiting by the troubles in Bulgaria, had
completely destroyed his property. He had
come to the town to obtain redress, but I
thought that his efforts would be fruitless.</p>

<p>Many gentlemen in Macedonia are owners
of large estates. Some of them are Greeks
by birth, and all foreign subjects; for foreign
subjects are now permitted to hold land in
Turkey on the same conditions as the subjects
of the Porte. Having capital at their
command, and being more intelligent than
the Turks, they improve their property, and
realize from seven to ten per cent profit; but
even their estates are not quite free from the
attacks and depredations of brigands, who
often prevent them from visiting their farms
freely, or introducing all the improvements
they are desirous of making. Out of four of
these, three sent their sons to Europe, where
they were educated for the profession of
agriculturists, a proceeding quite unknown
among the Turkish proprietors. <i>Bonâ-fide</i>
Europeans are more respected and feared,
and consequently are not exposed to the hostilities
to which native Christians are subjected.
Some English gentlemen possessing
farms in Macedonia have had no occasion to
complain, even in these disordered times,
when perfect anarchy prevails; their property
has been respected, and every assistance is
afforded them by the local authorities.</p>

<p>Estates can also be rented for a mere trifle,
and when restored to good condition are said
to yield lucrative returns. Here again, however,
great care has to be taken to ascertain
that they are not disputed property, and, in
the case of their belonging to several individuals
of one family, that all are of age, and
sign the title-deeds. A case was related to
me by a member of the civil court of A⸺
of a rayah who had rented an estate from a
Turkish family, consisting of a widow and
her three sons, all of whom were of age and
had signed the contract together with their
mother. The tenant, who was a man of
moderate means, set to work to improve the
property, and spent £1000 upon it; but just
as he was beginning to realize the profits of
his toil and outlay, a fourth son of the widow
came of age and disputed the validity of the
contract. The case was tried before the local
civil court, and the rayah was declared to
have justice on his side; but as the case was
one of heritage, the Turk had the right to
transfer it to the Mehkemé, or religious court
of the Kadi, which decided it in his favor.
The result was that the tenant was driven
out of his estate, and lost all the money he
had spent upon it.</p>

<p>Almost every village in Roumelia and Macedonia,
and in fact all over Turkey, had once
its own common and forest, in which the
peasant proprietors, under certain laws and
regulations, had the right to burn charcoal,
cut wood, and let the pasturage in spring to
the herdsmen, who brought down their sheep
and cattle and kept them there the greater
part of summer. This was a great resource
for the rural population, who, in bad years,
could always make some profit out of it.</p>

<p>After the organization of the vilayet system
this privilege was curtailed, and the forests
and grazing grounds were placed under
government supervision. A Forest Department
was established at Constantinople, and
a chief inspector appointed in every district,
together with agents to superintend the pasturages.
The laws that were to regulate
these were said to be excellent, and, whilst
equitable towards the peasants, promised at
the same time to yield considerable revenues
to the state. One of these regulations set
forth that a portion of forest and pasturage
land should be left to the use of each village,
securing its provision of fuel and pasturage
for its cattle. None of these laws were, however,
observed in the interior, and nothing
definite was decided with respect to either of
these rights.</p>

<p>The beys, through bribery and favoritism,
continued to enjoy their ancient privileges
over the forests and grazing lands, while the
forest inspectors are said to have realized
such immense profits that every official was
desirous of becoming connected with the
Forest Department. The Government at the
beginning, no doubt, derived some good receipts
from this new source, but the great expense
inseparable from it, the robberies that
took place, and the destruction of property
allowed, could not fail, in the long-run, to be
injurious to its interests. The abuses, partiality,
and waste that mark the proceedings
of this branch of the administration are most
prejudicial to the rural population.</p>

<p>But the agents of pasture lands and the
forest keepers are still more tyrannical.</p>

<p>The extent of these grounds in the government
possession was never defined, nor has a
limit ever been drawn. The beys rented the
commons to the herdmasters; the contracts
were made with the cognizance of the local
authorities, and on stamped paper. Some of
the villages that possessed pasturage let it to
the Wallachian sheep-owners, who, in the
early part of spring, migrate annually into
Macedonia to pasture their flocks on the commons.</p>

<p>Some herdsmen had made contracts for
bringing down 300,000 sheep into the plains,
paid the fees for the contract, and the stipulated
sum to the peasants. All the arrangements
seemed in perfect order until the
arrival of the flocks upon the different grazing
grounds, when they were driven off with
violence and brutality by the forest-keepers
and their subordinates, who declared that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
they had no right to the pasturage unless
they paid the rent. The poor people produced
their contract to show that they had
paid the money, and refused to do so a second
time; justly observing that, if any illegal
action existed in the renting of the pasturage,
it regarded the Government and the villagers,
and not them, and that the Government
should reclaim the money from the
peasants. This dispute lasted a week; some
of the Wallachians referred it to the local
authorities, while others in their distress applied
to any person from whom assistance
could be expected. Day after day these
men, women, and children might be seen in
the streets of the town with desponding,
careworn faces, anxiously looking out for
some of their people who might tell them how
the case was prospering. When I saw them
no more about the town, I asked one of the
principal officials how the affair had terminated;
he replied, “Madame, malheureusement
le gouvernement n’a pas su encore
mettre toutes ces choses en ordre, et il nous
arrive souvent de ces cas tristes; mais ça
vient d’être arrangé.” He would not enlighten
me further on the subject, but I subsequently
learnt that a great amount of
bakhshish had settled the matter in favor of
the Wallachians.</p>

</div>

<p>The land south of the Balkans, from the
Black Sea to the frontier of Macedonia, is divided
into small holdings, which belong to
and are farmed by a peasant population of
an essentially agricultural nature. Before
the late destruction of property in Bulgaria,
almost every peasant in those districts was a
proprietor of from five to forty acres, which
he farmed himself. The larger estates, of
which there were a considerable number, were
superintended by the proprietors themselves,
but farmed by hired laborers. The following
figures will give an idea of the average
extent of the holdings in those districts:
Out of a thousand farms, three had five hundred
acres; thirty had between one hundred
and five hundred; three hundred between
fifty and a hundred; four hundred between
ten and fifty; and two hundred and sixty-seven
under ten acres. All these lands were
well cultivated and yielded rich returns. I
was astonished at the beauty and flourishing
condition of the country during a journey I
made some years ago from Adrianople to
Servia. It appeared like a vast and fruitful
garden. The peace-loving and toiling Bulgarian
was seen everywhere steadily going
through his daily work, while his equally
active and industrious wife and daughters
were cheerfully working by his side. <i>En
route</i>, I stopped a few days in the lovely town
of Kezanlik, and was most kindly received by
its well-to-do and intelligent inhabitants, who
pressed their hospitality upon me with a genuine
kindness never to be forgotten. I visited
the schools, in which the people prided
themselves as much as in the astonishing
progress the pupils were making in their
studies. I was also taken on a round of
visits into well-built clean houses where
European furniture was beginning to find a
place, and contrasted pleasantly with the
well-made native tissues that covered sofas
and floors. At dawn next morning a tap at
my door announced that it was time to rise
and witness the rose-gathering, which I
wished to see. The roses begin to be collected
before sunrise, in order to keep in
them all the richness of their perfume. It
requires expedition and many hands; so
large bands of young men and maidens,
adding pleasure to toil whilst gathering the
roses, amuse themselves by carrying on their
innocent little flirtations and love-makings.</p>

<p>The large garden to which I was conducted
belonged to the wealthy Chorbadji in whose
house I was staying. It was at some distance
from the town, and by the time we
reached it the bright rays of a lovely spring
morning were fast spreading over the horizon.
The field was thickly planted with rose-bushes,
with their rich harvest of half-open
dew-laden buds. The nightingales, in
flights, hovered over them, disputing their
possession with the light-hearted Bulgarian
harvesters, and chorusing with their rich
notes the gay songs of the scattered company,
who, dressed in their <i>Prasnik</i> (feast-day)
clothes,—the youths in snow-white shirts and
gaudy sleeveless vests, the girls in their picturesque
costume, the colored kerchiefs on
their heads floating in the breeze,—had the
appearance of a host of butterflies flitting
over the flowers. The girls were actively
and cheerfully employed in stripping off the
buds and throwing them into the baskets
slung on their arms. The youths helped them
in the task, and were rewarded each with a
bud from his sweetheart, which he placed in
his cap. The children ran to and fro emptying
the baskets into larger receptacles presided
over by the matrons, who sat under the
shade of the trees and sorted the roses. The
whole picture was so bright and happy, in
such harmony with the luxuriant beauty surrounding
it, that I was perfectly fascinated
by it, and felt almost envious of those happy
beings (as I then thought them), the careless
simple children of nature. Their happiness
was not for long.</p>

<p>It is not a week since my attention was
attracted by an article in one of our papers
describing the destruction of Kezanlik and
the horrors the writer had witnessed. The
once smiling and fruitful district was become
the valley of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the villages in
Bulgaria was very pleasing. Those in the
plains were not so well built or so picturesque
as those nestled among the hills, where the
abundance and cheapness of the material
needed for building afforded greater facilities
for more solid and more artistic construction.
Some of these villages had increased to such
an extent as to look like small towns. This
was owing to the more equal division of land
among the people and the large number of
landed proprietors that cultivated it. In the
midst of the difficulties that surrounded them,
such as an irregular and unequal system of
taxation and the encroachment and tyrannies
of petty government officials, Zaptiehs, Circassians,
and sometimes native beys—the
Bulgarian peasant, by his steady and persevering
habits of industry, managed to get on,
and in some places, when favored by circumstances,
even to become wealthy. A species
of lending fund was organized (since the introduction
of the vilayet system) by the provincial
government, chiefly for the benefit of
the peasant class of proprietors. The capital
of this fund was derived from an annual tax
of two bushels of wheat (or their equivalent
in money) levied on every yoke of oxen
owned by the farmers, and of money contributed
by those not engaged in agriculture,
to the value of one-tenth of their income-tax.
The agricultural interest of the
country derived great advantage from this
institution. It helped the small farmers to
borrow the sum needed for the cultivation of
their crops and the purchase of stock at a
reasonable rate of interest, and enabled those
who had large estates to improve them without
mortgaging; while others were enabled
to free their estates from the mortgages which
already burdened them. I believe that this
excellent institution did not long continue in
working order, and that latterly it was beyond
the reach of those who really needed
the money and might have benefited both
their farms and the State by its use.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the Bulgarian peasant is
not wealthy. There are many villages that
were so deeply in debt that for years they
had not been able to pay their taxes. A rising
was occasioned in one of the villages of
the district of Sofia on this account. The
Pasha of Sofia had been pressed by the Porte
to send some money to Constantinople; he,
on his part, had to collect it from the people.
Calling up a Chaoush of Zaptiehs, he told
him to make the round of the villages, and,
under pain of instant dismissal, not to return
empty-handed. The Zaptieh was a bandit,
like many of his brethren who have represented
the police corps since the diminution
of pay and abolition of the excellent body
that had been organized by the wise policy of
Fuad Pasha and Ali Pasha. He marched
with his band into one of the villages and demanded
that £400 should at once be paid to
him. The men were absent from the village,
and the women, not authorized to act in such
matters, could not accede to his demand.
The Zaptiehs then seized some and locked
them up in a barn, and, after subjecting them
to gross ill-treatment, left the village. The
unfortunate peasants, thus pressed by the
authorities for taxes they could not pay, and
subjected to foul and violent treatment, revolted.</p>

<p>A Bulgarian cottage is neither neat nor regular
in construction. A number of poles are
stuck in the ground, secured to each other by
wattles, plastered within and without with
clay and cow-dung mixed with straw. The
walls are generally whitewashed, and the
roof raised to a dome covered with tiles or
thatch. The interior, divided into three
rooms, is neat and clean. One of the apartments
is used as the living-room of the family,
another as sleeping-room, while the third is
reserved for storing provisions and such-like
domestic purposes. These rooms are of
tolerable height, and from fifteen to twenty
feet long and ten to fifteen wide. The
earthen floor is hardened and covered
with coarse matting and woollen rugs, the
handiwork of the inmates. The furniture
consists principally of the thick woven tissues
used for bedding and carpeting.</p>

<p>Pictures of the saints and relics from Mount
Athos adorn the walls; a night-lamp may be
seen suspended before the most venerated of
these objects, serving the double purpose of
<i>veilleuse</i> and mark of regard to the saint.
The shelves round the walls contain the
crockery and shining copper pans, a pair of
pistols, and various other articles. The bedding,
neatly rolled up, is piled in one corner,
while near the door stand the jars of fresh
water. Attached to these cottages are sheds
for the farm stock; and a cow-house, pig-sty,
and poultry-house, an oven, and sometimes a
well, are inclosed in the yard, which is surrounded
by walls or fences, and guarded by
dogs.</p>

<p>In the hilly districts, the cottages of both
Mohammedans and Christians are constructed
with considerable solidity. The peasants
throughout European Turkey are economical
and frugal; their wants are few, and they
are content with very little. They seldom
taste fresh meat, and generally live on rye
bread and maize porridge, or beans seasoned
with vinegar and pepper. The dairy produce
is consumed at home, and on great occasions
a young pig or lamb serves as a <i>pièce de résistance</i>,
washed down by home-made wine.
For pastry they have a cake called <i>Banitza</i>,
much relished by all.</p>

<p>The clothing of the peasants is warm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
comfortable. It is chiefly composed of woollen
stuffs, coarse linen, or cotton cloth. Every
single article of wearing apparel is woven,
embroidered, and made up by the hands of
the women, who are at the same time spinners,
weavers, and tailors. When coming to
town, and on <i>Prasnik</i> days, coarse socks and
sandals are worn; these are also home-made,
and their use on other occasions is dispensed
with.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian peasant is strong and healthy
in appearance. Both in Bulgaria and Macedonia
he is a diligent worker. He may not
have the smartness and activity of the English
laborer, but I have often been assured
that, notwithstanding the numerous feast-days
he keeps, at the end of the year he is
found to have completed almost as much
work, for the simple reason that he makes his
working-day much longer, and his whole
family turn out to assist him; for the women
of these districts are as industrious as the
men: no sooner are their household tasks accomplished
than they join the paterfamilias
in the field.</p>

<p>The German and Italian engineers who undertook
the construction of the railways in
Macedonia repeatedly asserted that the labor
of the natives was equal to that of Europeans.
In Macedonia, the Italian company,
on commencing operations, brought out five
hundred Italian navvies to work on the line;
but on discovering that the natives, when
well paid, well treated, and shown how to set
about it, did the work better than the
Italians, the latter were sent away. These
gentlemen were most warm in their praises
of the steadiness of the men and of the excellence
of their work; but I must add that
they did not omit to study the character of
the people and treat them with the kindness
and consideration that, in the long-run, never
fail to improve and elevate even the most
debased.</p>

<p>The Turkish peasants, who are in the minority
both in Bulgaria and Macedonia, have
also a healthy appearance, added in the
former place to a look of audacity, and in the
latter to a look of ferocity. The Greek peasant
is tall and rather slim, with an intelligent
look and a hardy and self-reliant expression.</p>

<p>All the rural population is sober. Greek
and Bulgarian peasants have, it is true, every
now and then, an orgy; but there is no systematic
drunkenness. All the well-to-do
farmers and peasants keep a provision of
wine and <i>raki</i>, or spirit, but their daily portion
is moderate, and excesses are only indulged
in on feast-days, and even these are
not of a very serious nature.</p>

<p>All the villages, both Greek and Bulgarian,
have their <i>Kodja-Bashis</i>, who see to the administration
of the village, proportion the
taxes, settle petty disputes, attend to the arrival
and reception of guests, Zaptiehs and
troops, and other wants or necessities of the
community.</p>

<p>The Turkish villages bear a more impoverished
appearance and look more neglected
and decaying than the Christian. This is
partly owing to the seclusion of the women,
who are little seen about, and, unlike the
Christian, never sit working at their doors.
They are helpless; do no field work, and
very little weaving; and occupy themselves
solely about their in-door duties, and as these
are not very heavy, they consequently spend
much of their time idly. The men are laborious,
but not so active and energetic as the
Christians. They spend a good deal of time
smoking in the coffee-houses of the village,
and are much poorer than the Christians.
This is due partly to their character and to
the absence of all help from their wives, but
also in great part to the conscription, which
takes many valuable years of labor from the
working-man. Drunkenness is rare among
Turks of this class, but when chance cases
occur they are of the most vicious and incurable
kind.</p>

<p>In Macedonia landed property is more unequally
divided than in Bulgaria. Great portions
of it are united in large estates held by
native beys, or by pashas and officials at Constantinople.
Some of these estates comprise
an immense area, of which only a part is cultivated.
They are called <i>Chiftliks</i>; the
house, or <i>Konak</i>, on the estate, is the residence
of the owner when he visits it, for he
seldom resides on his property, but is represented
by a <i>Soubashi</i>, or agent. The elegance,
dimensions, and comfort of the Konak depend,
of course, upon the means and habits
of the owner. Some of the more ancient of
these edifices are large and spacious, built in
the style of the old Konaks at Stamboul;
but they present a still more dilapidated and
neglected appearance. Others of more recent
erection are smaller, but neither more
comfortable nor more tidy in appearance.
Some, again, are in the form of turrets,
which, if not elegant, have at least the merit
of being as strong as small fortresses. A
large court-yard contains, beside the house,
the usual farm buildings. On entering the
yard of the best regulated <i>Chiftlik</i>, the first
thing that attracts the attention is the air of
complete disorder and dirt that pervades the
premises. In one or two corners may be seen
heaps of refuse, in others broken carts and
farm implements standing in the midst of
mud-pools and filth of every description, including
a collection of old brooms that could
never have been worn out in sweeping the
place. Among these, children, fowls, geese,
ducks, and dogs roam in freedom. The interior
of the Konak is usually divided into Haremlik
and Selamlik, if sufficiently large. One or two
rooms in each department may be furnished
with a few hard sofas and dingy calico curtains.
The room reserved for the master
sometimes presents a somewhat better appearance,
its walls decorated with fire-arms, sometimes
of beautiful workmanship, and its furniture
boasting a deal table and a few chairs.
When the Bey intends paying a long visit
to his estate and is accompanied by his family,
the bedding and other household necessaries
are brought from town. It is astonishing
to see how little luggage a Turkish family
travels with on such an occasion. Each
person will have a <i>boghcha</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> containing his or
her wearing apparel; the articles for general
use comprise a few candlesticks, petroleum
lamps, perhaps two <i>Leyen</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and <i>Ibrik</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for
ablutions, which in the morning and at meal
times make the round of the house; kitchen
utensils and a few tumblers, plates, etc., are
all that is needed for the <i>Villeggiatura</i> of a
Turkish family.</p>

<p>The way in which the Bey spends his time
on his estate is also regulated by the means
and tastes of the individual. If he be a
sportsman, he will have a battue on his lands
and enjoy the pleasures of the chase. Should
he be addicted to drinking and debauchery,
he has every means of indulging his taste.
His duties as landlord consist in regulating
accounts with his agent, hearing the cases
that need his interference, giving general instructions
for future operations, and, above
all, realizing the profits. As to improving
his estate, ameliorating the condition of the
tenants, beautifying the property by planting
trees and laying out gardens, such things are
never thought of or known to have been
practised by any large land-owner in Macedonia.</p>

<p>The harem, on their side, bring friends to
stay with them; and the days are spent in
roaming out barefooted in the most <i>négligés</i>
costumes, eating fruit, and helping to make
the winter provisions, such as <i>Tarhana Kouskous</i>,
<i>Youfka</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> <i>Petmaiz</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> <i>Rechel</i>,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
<i>Nichesteh</i>.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> No needlework is brought to fill up the
leisure hours of country life; the only amusements
are the indecent conversation and the
practical jokes of the parasites who never fail
to accompany such parties.</p>

<p>The villages owned by the bey are made up
of the dwellings of the tenants. These for the
most part present a pitiable appearance of
poverty and misery, though their interiors
are as clean as circumstances will allow.
They are constructed of mud and wattle, and
divided into two or three rooms, with small
openings for windows, and open chimneys.
A fence incloses the house, together with the
granary and cattle-shed. The tenants are,
with few exceptions, Christians, and are called
<i>Yeradjis</i>. They are poor, and look dejected
and depressed, a demeanor I have often heard
superficial observers attribute to laziness and
natural worthlessness. This judgment may
be just in some instances, but can by no
means be taken as generally correct; the
people are as willing to work and gain an
honest living as those of any other land, but
they labor under certain disadvantages which
merit attention, and which, when carefully
examined, will go far to justify their failings.</p>

<p>A Yeradji’s house costs from £30 to £50;
sometimes it is built by the landlord, sometimes
by the tenant himself. This may happen
for instance when the Yeradji has a son
to marry and the landlord refuses to build a
house for him, in which case he has to build
it at his own expense, and should he leave
the estate, receives no compensation for it.
These <i>Chiftliks</i> are cultivated on the Metayer
system as it is understood and practised in
Macedonia: the landlord provides the seed in
the first instance, the Yeradji finds his own
yoke of oxen or buffaloes and implements,
tills the ground, sows the grain, reaps it,
threshes and winnows it, and when the seed
for the next year and the tithes have been
deducted, shares the produce with the landlord.
The Metayer system on a luxuriant
soil like that of Macedonia would not only
pay, but would also contribute to increase the
wealth of the estate and improve the wretched
condition of the Yeradji if it were only properly
and equitably administered. But it is
not difficult to point out capital failings in the
working of the system. When the grain is
cut, a certain number of sheaves, forty for
instance, of the finest and heaviest, are set
aside as samples. These are threshed separately,
and the seed for the next year, the
tithes, and the landlord’s share deducted according
to this standard, which leaves the
Yeradji an iniquitously small proportion of
the produce. Under this unfair arrangement
the Yeradji has to give for every head of cattle
he possesses six Constantinople kilés of
barley and six of wheat to the <i>Soubashi</i> of his
bey.</p>

<p>In addition to these the Yeradji has to defray
the heavy burden of his own taxes, and
the quartering of troops and Zaptiehs upon
him, besides other burdens, among which
must be reckoned the wasted time of the
numerous feast-days, that deprive him of so
much work in the year. Toil as hard as he
may, he can never become an independent
and prosperous man.</p>

<p>When these estates are transferred by sale
or other causes, the Yeradji, should he be in
debt to the estate, goes with it into a sort of
bondage terminable under certain conditions,
viz.: his industry and activity and the honesty
of the landlord and his agent. If on
one hand the superabundance of feast-days
is to be looked upon as a hindrance to the
Yeradji freeing himself from debt, the unscrupulous
manner in which his master or
the Soubashi reckons accounts opposes fresh
obstacles to the breaking of the chain that
binds him to the soil. Farm accounts are
generally kept by means of <i>chetolas</i>, or notched
sticks, a very primitive mode, leading to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
many errors being committed, wittingly or
unwittingly. The consequence is that all
tenants are more or less in debt to their landlords
in the same manner as all Turkish landlords
are in debt to the Government or to private
individuals.</p>

<p>The scarcity of Yeradjis and their disqualifications
as tenants are now a general complaint
throughout Macedonia. It is not, however,
surprising that the better class of peasants
should refuse to become Yeradjis, and
that the inferior classes, employed in their
absence, should be found fault with and be
always in debt.</p>

<p>Of late years some of these estates have
passed into the hands of Christians, by purchase
or mortgage. These proprietors, as a
rule, do not reside on their estates, which are
left in the charge of an agent, but content
themselves with an occasional visit. When
this property is well situated, and (as seldom
happens) free from litigation, it is said to be a
good investment.</p>

<p>Besides these Yeradji villages, there are
the <i>Kephalochoria</i>, or head-villages, composed
of petty landholders, some of whom were
formerly wealthy, and might have continued
so but for the injury done to them by the forest
regulations and the heavy impositions laid
upon them by the Government since the commencement
of the war.</p>

<p>One of the principal grievances peasants
labor under is the <i>angaria</i>, or statute-labor,
into which man, beast, and cart are impressed
at the command of a mere Zaptieh, causing a
loss of time, and injury to property and
cattle, which is often fatal to an otherwise
well-to-do village. A village on a main road
is never free from all kinds of vexatious impositions
and the quartering of Zaptiehs and
troops, who, whether they pay or not for
what they have consumed, extort sums of
money from their hosts, and are always careful
to take away with them a declaration
from the <i>Kodja-Bashi</i> that all accounts have
been settled.</p>

<p>The Angaria work lately exacted from the
inhabitants of Cavalla for the transport of
flour for the use of the army was very nearly
occasioning troubles of a nature likely to
prove fatal to the whole town. The affair
originated in the townspeople being required
to carry on Sunday loads which they willingly
carried on Saturday. They refused, and
shut themselves up in their houses; whereupon
an excess of zeal was displayed by the
police in trying to force them out by breaking
into some of the dwellings. This led to
a slight disturbance which encouraged some
noted bad characters belonging to the Moslem
population to take a menacing attitude, and
conspire to break into the offices of some of
the principal merchants of the town, ransack
them, and then proceed to follow the precedent
with the rest of the town, threatening
the Christians with massacre. Panic soon
spread, and the people shut themselves in
their churches. Men-of-war were telegraphed
for, but luckily the local authorities were
able to put down the tumult, and order was
restored without loss of life. The incident
is instructive in showing the difficulties and
dangers under which the Macedonian peasant
carries on his work. It is no wonder that the
land is ill-cultivated.</p>

<p>Among the peasant farmers of Roumelia
there is no regular system of rotation of
crops observed; but with the occupants of
large estates the ordinary rule for rich lands
is two wheat crops and one of oats, then fallow
one or more years, wheat, and then
sesame. In Macedonia, where arable land is
more abundant, one year’s rest is allowed to
some lands. The only manure some of these
lands obtain is from the treading of the sheep
on the land in early spring and after the harvest
is reaped, and yet the soil is naturally
so rich that a generally bad harvest is of rare
occurrence. The mode of cultivation is very
primitive, employing much hand labor and
involving much waste. Tillage is performed
with the native plough, on an average depth
of four inches to the furrow. The instrument
used for the purpose is very rude and
has only one handle. The number of buffaloes
used varies from two to five. In Roumelia
some large estate owners attempted introducing
agricultural implements from
Europe, but threshing-machines alone met
with any success. In Macedonia even these
proved a failure, as their management is not
understood, and fuel is difficult to procure in
the interior. In some parts the grain is scattered
over the stubble and then ploughed in.
Much of the harvest is done by young women
and girls in Roumelia and Macedonia. They
and the male harvesters hire themselves for
the June harvest. On the 21st August the
harvest-home is celebrated. Decked in their
holiday costumes, crowned with garlands,
and carrying bouquets composed of ears of
corn, the reapers proceed to the nearest town
to dance and sing before the doors of the
principal houses and in the market-place.</p>

<p>Threshing is performed in the most antique
manner imaginable. The instrument
used for the purpose consists of two pieces of
wood curved at one end, fastened together,
and studded with a number of flints. This
is attached at the curved end to a team of
three or four horses. A girl stands on this
sledge and drives the team rapidly over the
corn thrown in bundles on the ground, which
has been hardened and prepared for the purpose.
This process breaks the straw into
very small lengths, making it very palatable
food for the cattle. The corn is winnowed
by being thrown up in the air with wooden
shovels, the breeze carrying away the chaff.
In some parts of Macedonia the process is
even more simple. A team of horses is driven
over the bundles of corn, treading out the
grain. The women and children also sit on
the ground and help in the operation by beating
it with sticks.</p>

<p>The principal crops raised in Roumelia are
wheat, barley, maize, rye, oats, sesame, and
canary-seed. A considerable quantity of
rice is grown in some parts. In the south,
towards Adrianople, the vine reaches some
degree of perfection, and excellent wine is
made, which, when kept for some years, resembles
sherry in taste and color. The mulberry
grows abundantly, and before the silkworm
disease appeared in those districts
formed a very profitable branch of industry.
The mulberry gardens sometimes comprise
several acres of land; when they are near
towns or large villages, the silkworm nurseries
are placed in them. The rearing process
begins in early spring, with the budding of
the leaves, and lasts over two months. It is
a very tedious and laborious work, requiring
great neatness and attention, and is generally
undertaken by the women. When the crop
succeeds and is free from disease, it is an interesting
process to watch. In Macedonia
the same crops are grown, with the addition
of a large supply of excellent tobacco. The
best comes from Drama and Cavalla.</p>

<p>The cattle in Turkey, though small, are
hardy and very serviceable. Little attention
has hitherto been paid by the Government towards
improving the breed. The sheep, too,
are small, and their wool is of an inferior
quality. Those in Asiatic Turkey are mostly
of the Karamanian, or broad-tailed, breed.
Their fat is much used by the natives for
cookery, and their milk made into cheese.
Sheep-farming is carried on to a great extent
both in European and Asiatic Turkey.
Buffaloes for draft purposes and ploughing,
and camels as beasts of burden, are very
numerous, especially in Asia Minor. Great
numbers of goats are also kept; their milk is
much used for making cheese. The Angora
goats are (I need hardly say) much prized for
their fleece. Their introduction into other
parts of the country has been attempted several
times, but has invariably failed. They do
not thrive away from their native mountains.</p>

</div>

<p>Bright sunshine, fresh air, ample space,
and pure water are indispensable to the felicity
of a Turk. Both in the capital and in
provincial towns the Turkish quarter is invariably
situated in the most healthy and elevated
parts, and occupies, on account of the
gardens belonging to almost every Turkish
house, double the ground of the Christian
and Jewish quarters. These gardens are all
more or less cultivated, but, except in the
capital, where horticulture has obtained some
degree of perfection, they seldom display
either taste or order. A few fine mulberry
or other fruit trees may be seen here and
there overshadowing patches of ground bordered
with box or tiles, and planted with
roses, lettuces, and garlic; and in the gardens
of the better class of houses one may
often see pretty fountains.</p>

<p>The streets of the Turkish quarter are narrow
and irregular, and, except in the principal
thoroughfares, look solitary and deserted;
they are, however, cleaner than those of
the Christian and Jewish quarters, and this
for three good reasons: they are little frequented;
they are not encumbered with rubbish,
owing to the space the Turks possess in
their court-yards and gardens, where they can
heap up most of the refuse that the Christians
have to throw into the streets; and
they are better patrolled by the street dogs,
for these famous scavengers, being under the
special protection of the Mussulman, are
more numerous in the Turkish than in the
other quarters, and eat up all the animal and
vegetable refuse.</p>

<p>A Turkish <i>konak</i>, or mansion, is a large
building, very irregular in construction, and
without the slightest approach to European
ideas of comfort or convenience. This building
is divided into two parts, the <i>haremlik</i>
and the <i>selamlik</i>; the former and larger part
is allotted to the women, the latter is occupied
by the men and is used for the transaction
of business, the purposes of hospitality,
and formal receptions. The stables are attached
to it, forming part of the ground-floor,
and rendering some of the upper rooms
rather unpleasant quarters. A narrow passage
leading from the <i>mabeyn</i> (or neutral
ground) to the <i>haremlik</i> joins the two establishments.
The materials used for building
are wood, lime, mud, and stone for the foundations.
A Konak generally consists of two
stories, one as nearly as possible resembling
the other, with abundant provision for the
entrance of light and air. A large hall, called
the <i>devankhané</i>, forms the entrance into the
Haremlik; it is surrounded by a number of
rooms of various sizes. To the right, the
largest serves as a sort of ante-chamber, the
rest are sleeping apartments for the slaves,
with the exception of one called <i>kahvé-agak</i>,
where an old woman is always found sitting
over a charcoal brazier, ready to boil coffee
for every visitor. A large double staircase
leads to the upper story, on one side of which
is the <i>kiler</i>, or store-room, and on the other
the lavatories. The floors are of deal, kept
scrupulously clean and white, and in the
rooms generally covered with mats and rugs.
The furniture is exceedingly poor and
scanty; a hard uncomfortable sofa runs
along two and sometimes three sides of the
room; a <i>shelté</i>, or small square mattress, occupies
each corner, surmounted by a number of
cushions piled one upon the other in regular
order. The corner of the sofa is the seat of
the Hanoum, and by the side of the cushions
are placed her mirror and <i>chekmegé</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>A small European sofa, a few chairs placed
stiffly against the wall, a console supporting
a mirror and decorated with two lamps or
candlesticks, together with a few goblets and
a small table standing in the centre with
cigarettes and tiny ash-trays, complete the
furniture of the grandest provincial <i>Buyukoda</i>.
Though some Turks possess many rare
and curious objects, such as ancient armor
and china, which, if displayed, would greatly
add to the elegance and cheerfulness of their
apartments, these are always kept packed
away in boxes.</p>

<p>Windows are the great inconvenience in
Turkish houses; they pierce the walls on
every side, with hardly the space of a foot between
them. The curtains are usually of
coarse printed calico, short and scanty, with
the edges pinked out, so that when washed
they present a miserably ragged appearance.
The innumerable windows render the houses
ill-adapted either for hot or cold weather;
the burning rays of the sun pour in all day in
summer, and the frames are so badly constructed
that the cold wind enters in all directions
in winter.</p>

<p>Bedsteads are not used by the Turks; mattresses
are nightly spread on the floor, and
removed in the morning into large cupboards,
built into the walls of every room.
These walls, being whitewashed and roughly
furnished, increase the uncomfortable appearance
of the rooms, which at night are
dimly lighted by one or two sperm candles or
a petroleum lamp, the successors of the ancient
tallow candle. The halls and passages
are left in obscurity, and the servants find
their way about as well as they can.</p>

<p>The <i>mangals</i>, or braziers, are the warming
apparatus generally used by the Turks in
their houses. These are made of different
metal; some fixed in wooden frames, others
in frames of wrought brass of very elegant
and costly workmanship. The fuel consists
of a quantity of wood ashes in which burning
charcoal is half buried.</p>

<p>The <i>tandour</i>, now nearly fallen into disuse,
is also worthy of notice. It consists of
a square deal table with a foot-board covered
with tin, on which a brazier stands; the
whole is covered with a thick quilted counterpane
which falls in heavy folds on a sofa
running round it, covering the loungers up
to the chin, and giving one the idea of a
company of people huddled together in bed.
The tandour is still very much used in Smyrna,
and round it the Levantine ladies love to
sit during the winter months. More than
one English traveller, newly arrived in the
country, when ushered into a drawing-room,
is said to have rushed frantically out again
under the impression that he had surprised
the family in bed.</p>

<p>The furniture of the <i>selamlik</i> is similar to
that of the Haremlik. A family often removes
from one set of apartments to another; this
propensity is doubtless stimulated by the desire
to escape from the assaults of the fleas
and other vermin that swarm in the rooms.
When once these insects obtain a footing in
a house, it is difficult to get rid of them,
partly on account of the unwillingness of the
Turks to destroy animal life of any description,
and partly because these insects take up
their abode between the badly joined planks
under the mats and rugs.</p>

<p>I was once visiting at the house of a Pasha
lately arrived at Adrianople. The Hanoum,
a charming woman, was complaining bitterly
to me of her rest having been much disturbed
the previous night by the abundance of these
creatures in her apartment. One of the
slaves modestly remarked that she had occupied
herself all the morning in scalding the
floor of the room her mistress had slept in,
and expressed a hope that she would not be
longer troubled in that respect. A general
outcry against this slave’s want of humanity
was raised by all the women present, and a
chorus of “Yuzuk! Gunah!” (Pity! Sin!)
was heard. It is curious that they raised no
such outcry when they heard of the frightful
destruction of human life that took place a
few years later among their Christian neighbors
in Bulgaria, but a few miles from their
own secure homes!</p>

<p>When in the interior I had the opportunity
of visiting some Konaks worthy of note; one
of these called Bordofska, situated in the
heart of Albania, some leagues from Uskup,
had been built as a country residence by the
famous Hevni Pasha. It was an immense
building, solidly constructed of stone at the
expense and with the forced labor of the people,
who were pressed into the work. It occupied
the middle of a large garden that must
have been beautiful in its time, and being
surrounded by high walls bore a strong resemblance
to a feudal castle. This fine old
building had become the property of Osman
Pasha, a venerable Turk of the old school;
all the furniture was European, and of a very
rich and elegant description, but looked worn
and neglected. The aged Pasha received me
with the politeness and hospitality his nation
knows so well how to show when it pleases.</p>

<p>After an interchange of civilities, and having
partaken of coffee, I was invited to visit
the harem. A hideous black monster, the
chief of the eunuchs, led the way through a
long dark passage lined with forty of his
brethren, not more pleasant-looking than
himself, who salaamed to me as I passed.</p>

<p>My then limited experiences of the customs
of harems made me regard this gloomy
passage and its black occupants with feelings
of curiosity, not unmingled with dread.
The chief wife of Osman Pasha (for I believe
he had six others, besides slaves) was a very
fat, elderly person, who showed little disposition
to give me the hearty and civil reception
I had just received from her husband,
and I soon discovered that she belonged to
that peculiar class of Turkish women called
<i>Soffous</i>—the <i>bas-bleus</i> of Mohammedanism,
bigoted zealots of the straitest sect of the
Moslem Pharisees.</p>

<p>On entering the room I found the Hanoum
seated in her sofa corner, from which she
did not rise but merely gave a bend of the
head, with a cold “Né yaparsen?”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in response
to my deep Oriental obeisance. She
spoke very little, and the few words she was
obliged to utter were intermingled with
<i>Duvas</i> she muttered; perhaps asking forgiveness
for the sin she was committing in
holding direct intercourse with a <i>Giaour</i>.
The other wives, who were all pretty and
gay, tried to make amends for the ill-humor
of their <i>doyenne</i>, and were as kind and amiable
as etiquette would allow in her presence.</p>

<p>Four other Konaks of the same description
may still be seen outside the town of
Uskup, standing alongside in melancholy
decay. The first and largest was intended
for the residence of the once powerful Hevni
Pasha himself; the second for his son, and
the two others for his daughters. I was
deeply impressed by the sight of these imposing
ruins, and visited them with the double
object of satisfying my curiosity and ascertaining
the possibility of lodging myself
in some habitable corner of one of them during
my stay in the neighborhood. The interior
was well worth seeing, and comprised
splendid apartments, the walls and ceilings
being decorated with gildings and elaborate
carvings in walnut wood. The baths of
sculptured marble could still be taken as
models of that luxurious and indispensable
appendage to a Turkish house. A wing of
one of these buildings was habitable; but
when I proposed to install myself in it, some
natives who had accompanied our party objected,
saying the houses were <i>hursous</i> and
<i>nahletli</i>, having been cursed by the people at
whose expense, and by whose unrequited
labor, they had been erected. Even the
beasts, they said, that had carried the heavy
loads of building material were seen to look
up to heaven and groan under the pressure
of their burdens; and a prophet of the place
had foretold the downfall of the owner on
the day of the completion of the work. This
prophecy was fulfilled to the letter, for on
the day the Pasha was to have entered his
new abode, the Turkish Government, suspicious
of his growing power and wealth, managed
to lay hands upon him.</p>

<p>This Deri-Bey<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is said to have been a wonderfully
intelligent man, counterbalancing
many of his tyrannical actions by the zealous
care he showed in promoting the individual
safety of his people and in increasing their
prosperity. Though entirely uneducated, his
natural talents were great enough to enable
him to comprehend the advantages of modern
civilization, and to lead him to introduce
some recent inventions into the country; he
also attempted to render the river Vardar (the
ancient Axius) navigable.</p>

<p>Hevni Pasha and his <i>voïvodes</i>, or captains,
twenty-five or thirty years ago, may be
looked upon as the last representatives of the
chiefs of the wild Albanian clans, who at
that time still refused to recognize the authority
of the Porte, and when pressed to do
so broke out into open rebellion. Badjuksis
Ahmet Pasha, then a mere colonel, marched
with his regiment upon Uskup, one of the
principal strongholds of the Albanians, and,
partly by stratagem and partly by threats,
managed to penetrate into the town and take
possession of the fortress. In the meantime,
Frank Omar Pasha, the field-marshal, came
with some regular troops to his assistance,
having previously defeated the Albanians in
battle at Kaplan, and dispersed them into the
plains. He surrounded the town, and invited
Hevni Pasha with his captains and the principal
beys of the town into the fortress to
hear the Imperial Firman read. This ceremony
being concluded without disturbance,
Hevni Pasha and such of his party as were
likely to continue their resistance to the orders
of the Porte were requested by the military
authorities to mount at once the horses
that had been surreptitiously prepared for
them, and were conveyed under escort to
Constantinople, whence they were sent into
exile, their families being sent after them,
and their goods confiscated. Notice was next
given to the rest of the native beys that,
should any of them be found in direct or indirect
communication with the scattered
bands of Albanians, or sending provisions to
them, the guns of the fortress would be turned
upon the town, which would be razed to
the ground. This was a master-stroke on the
part of the Government; the Albanians, after
a few vain attempts at Monastir, Vrania,
Philippopolis, and other places, to resist the
authority of the Sultan, partially submitted
and returned to their impregnable mountain
fastnesses; not, however, without having
committed some barbarities similar to those
recently enacted in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>During my trip to Bazardjik, I visited another
konak: it belonged to Kavanos Oglou,
another of the too famous Deri-Beys, who
had acquired complete control over his part
of the country, and who was similarly seized
by the Porte, despoiled of his possessions,
and sent into exile. This konak was an immense
quadrangular building, inclosing a
court-yard with a veranda running round it
supported on massive wooden pillars. Upon
this veranda a hundred rooms opened. The
house was low and clumsy in appearance,
but timber of remarkable size and solidity
had been used in its construction.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit it was abandoned;
the doors and windows had disappeared,
giving to the edifice an appearance of solitude
and emptiness, rendered still more dismal
by the presence of innumerable bats and
owls, its only occupants. The old dungeon,
with its cruel associations, could still be traced
in a low building, about thirty feet long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and twenty wide, surrounded by a wall of
immense thickness and strongly roofed. For
windows nothing was seen but a few slits.
The interior on one side was occupied by a
double wall, with just enough space between
to admit a person in a standing position; in
this the offenders against the laws, and the
victims of vendetta, were squeezed, secured
by heavy chains that hung at equal distances
from iron rings. A well, now filled up, occupied
the centre, into which the heads of
decapitated prisoners were thrown, to disappear
in the dismal darkness of its depths.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to leave this cheerless scene
of former despotism and present decay, and
to turn my steps towards a gate on the opposite
side of the garden leading into a kiosk
more modern in appearance than the house,
though bearing traces of decay. This last
refuge of a once powerful family was occupied
by Azizié Hanoum Effendi, the much-respected
widow of the tyrant. Her two
sons, who occupied inferior positions under
Government, were absent. The descendants
of Kavanos Oglou continue to be much respected
in the country in spite of their
downfall and the confiscation of their property.
The venerable lady into whose presence
I was ushered bore, notwithstanding
her advanced age, traces of a beauty that must
have been perfect in its bloom. She was a
fine tall blonde of the Circassian type, of a
commanding appearance, softened by the
sweet dignity of fallen sovereignty, before
whom I felt I could bow the knee and
kiss the hand she graciously extended to
me. I had a long and interesting conversation
with her on the state of the country,
which she described as having been more
flourishing under the rule of her husband
than at this time. “But,” said she, with a
sigh, “God ordains all things, casting some
into misfortunes and raising others into prosperity,
according as Kismet has prepared for
all. <i>Allah Kerim!</i>”</p>

<p class="tb">Every one has heard or read of a <i>kiosk</i>, the
indispensable pleasure-seat of a Turk. The
imperial and other kiosks on the Bosphorus
are miniature palaces, luxuriously furnished,
whose elegance and beauty are only equalled
by the incomparable advantages of their situation
on the richest of soils and beneath the
sunniest of skies. Kiosks may be situated
anywhere, and may comprise a suite of
apartments or be limited to one; they are
light and airy in style, generally commanding
a fine prospect, often floored with marble,
and containing a <i>shadravan</i>, or sculptured
fountain, playing in the midst; a range of
sofas runs all round the walls, on which the
Turk loves to sit for hours together lost in
meditation, and in the fumes of his inseparable
companion the <i>nargilé</i>.</p>

<p>The interiors of old kiosks and konaks
used to be ornamented with a peculiar open
woodwork of arabesque design decorating
the walls and ceilings, but this is now completely
out of fashion. The ceiling of a house
I formerly inhabited was decorated with this
work, and attracted the attention of all travellers.
One, an Englishman, was so much
struck with it on entering the room, that
hardly had he bowed to the company before
he asked permission to make a sketch of it.
We were so accustomed to similar displays
of originality in British tourists that the request
was at once granted.</p>

<p>A <i>koula</i> is a high turret found on every
large <i>chiftlik</i>, or farm, and used as a refuge
in case of assault by brigands; it is a quadrangular
edifice, from three to four stories
high; the lowest is used as a granary and for
storing seeds and other valuable property belonging
to the farm; the others, light and
airy, are reserved for the habitation of the
owner of the chiftliks during his occasional
visits to his property.</p>

<p>The last stronghold of this description I
visited was the property of a British subject in
the district of Salonika. It was solidly constructed,
with massive iron doors and shutters,
and some years ago resisted the assault
of a band of brigands who besieged it for three
days, till the arrival of a corps of Zaptiehs
occasioned their hasty disappearance. The
marks of their bullets may still be seen on
the doors and shutters, but no further damage
was done.</p>

<p>There is no very marked difference between
the quarters of the town occupied by
Christians and those occupied by Turks.
The Christians’ houses are built very much
in the same style, though they are not so
large, and open directly on the street, with
shops in their lower stories in the principal
thoroughfares. The windows are free from
the lattices invariably seen in a Turkish <i>haremlik</i>.
There is much more life and animation
in a Christian or Jewish quarter, partly
in consequence of one house being occupied
by several families. This is especially the
case among the lower orders of Jews, where
one may count as many families as there are
rooms in a house.</p>

<p>In most Eastern towns the Jewish quarters,
containing the fish, meat, and vegetable
markets, are the most unclean, and consequently
the most unhealthy. Few sanitary
regulations exist, and little attention is paid
to them or to the laws of hygiene. The streets
are frequently nearly impassable, and some
of the dwellings of the poor are pestilential,
the hotbeds of every epidemic that visits the
country.</p>

<p>Most of the ancient khans, warehouses,
and bazars at Stamboul, and in large provincial
towns, are fine solidly constructed edifices.
The bazars are of a peculiarly Oriental
style of architecture, and appear well adapted
to the use for which they were designed—the
display and sale of goods. In the interior,
however, many of these bazars are neglected,
and some left to decay have been by
degrees abandoned by the tenants of the innumerable
shops they once contained.</p>

<p>The <i>charshi</i>, or market-place, consists of an
incongruous assemblage of shops, huddled
together without any attempt at architecture
or regard to appearances; for the most part
protected only by large shutters that are
raised in the morning and lowered at night.
A low platform of boards occupies the greater
part of the interior, in the front corner of
which the shopkeeper sits on a little carpet,
cross-legged, with a wooden safe by his side
and his account-book and pipe within easy
reach, ever ready to attend to the wants of
his customers. Rows of shelves, constructed
in recesses in the walls, serve as receptacles
for his goods.</p>

<p>The <i>khans</i>, or warehouses, in towns are
used as deposits for merchandise and for the
transaction of business by merchants and
bankers who have offices in them. A series
of hostelries of all descriptions and dimensions,
also called khans, some built of stone
and others of timber, exist in large numbers
in all parts of the country, serving as hotels
to travellers and store-rooms for merchandise
during transit. The ruins of the most
ancient of these, built by the Turks at the
time of the conquest, and used by them as
blockhouses, still exist on the main roads and
in some of the principal towns. By the side
of these substantial stone buildings have
arisen a number of miserable edifices dignified
with the name of khan, with whose discomforts
the weary traveller too often makes
sad acquaintance.</p>

<p>The furniture of wealthy Greek houses in
Constantinople is European; in those of Jews
and Armenians of high position it is a compromise
between European and Turkish. All
Orientals are fond of display; they like to
build large houses and ornament their reception
rooms in a gaudy manner; but the <i>ensemble</i>
lacks finish and comfort. At A⸺ I
had fixed upon an old Turkish konak as my
residence; but on coming to inhabit it I discovered
that extensive alterations and improvements
must be made before it approached
in the remotest degree to my idea
of an English home. Some officious person,
at a loss to understand the object of these
changes, gave notice to the proprietor that
his tenant was fast demolishing his house,
upon which the good old Turk asked if she
were building it up again, and being answered
in the affirmative, quietly said,
“<i>Brak yupsen!</i>” (<i>laissez faire!</i>)</p>

<p>The furniture found in the dwellings of all
the lower classes is much the same throughout
the country; a Turkish sofa, a few deal
chairs, and a table serving for every purpose.
The bedding is placed on the floor at night
and removed in the morning. But if furniture
is scanty, there is no lack of carpets and
copper kitchen utensils, both being considered
good investments by the poor.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter I must not
forget to describe one of the most necessary
adjuncts to a Turkish house—the bath. In
a large house, or konak, this is by far the best
fitted and most useful part of the whole establishment.
A Turkish bath comprises a suite
of three rooms; the first—the <i>hammam</i>—is a
square apartment chiefly constructed of marble,
and terminating in a kind of cupola
studded with a number of glass bells, through
which the light enters. A deep reservoir,
attached to the outer wall, with an opening
into the bath, contains the water, half of
which is heated by a furnace built under it.
A number of pipes, attached to the furnace,
circulate through the walls of the bath and
throw great heat into it. One or two graceful
fountains conduct the water from the reservoir,
and on each side of the fountain is a
low wooden platform which serves as a seat
for the bather, who sits cross-legged, and undergoes
a long and complicated process of
washing and scrubbing, with a variety of
other toilet arrangements too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>The second room, called the <i>saouklouk</i>, is
constructed very much in the same style as
the first, but is smaller, and has no furniture
but a marble platform upon which mattresses
and cushions are placed for the use of those
who wish to repose between intervals of bathing,
or do not wish to face the cooler temperature
of the <i>hammam oda</i>. This room is furnished
with sofas, on which the bathers rest
and dress after quitting the bath.</p>

<p>Turkish women are very fond of their
bath, and are capable of remaining for hours
together in that hot and depressing atmosphere.
They smoke cigarettes, eat fruits and
sweets, and drink sherbet, and finally, after
all the blood has rushed to their heads, and
their faces are crimson, they wrap themselves
in soft burnouses, and pass into the third or
outer chamber, where they repose on a luxurious
couch until their system shakes off part of
the heat and languor that the abuse of these
baths invariably produces. A bath being an
indispensable appendage to every house, one
is to be found in even the poorest Turkish
dwelling. Some more or less resemble a regular
<i>hammam</i>, others are of a very simple
form—often a tiny cabinet attached to one of
the rooms, containing a bottomless jar buried
in the ground, through which the water runs.
I consider these little baths, which are neither
expensive nor require much space, excellent
institutions in the houses of the poor as instruments
of cleanliness. The constant and
careful ablutions of the Turk are the principal
preventives to many diseases, from
which they are, comparatively speaking,
freer than most nations.</p>

<p>The public baths, resorted to by all classes,
are to be found in numbers in every town.
They are fine buildings, exact copies of the
old Roman baths, many of which are still in
existence, defying the march of centuries
and the work of decay. Like the home
baths, they consist of three spacious apartments.
The outer bath-room is a large stone
building lighted by a cupola, with wooden
platforms running all round, upon which
small mattresses and couches are spread for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the men; but the women, not having the
same privilege, are obliged to bring their own
rugs, upon which they deposit their clothes,
tied up in bundles, when they enter, and repose
and dress upon them on coming out of
the bath. A fountain of cold water is considered
indispensable in this apartment, and
in the basin surrounding it may be seen water-melons
floating about, placed there to cool
while their owners are in the inner bath.</p>

<p>The bath itself contains a number of small
rooms, each of which can be separately engaged
by a party, or used in common with
the other bathers. It is needless to say that
the baths used by men are either separate or
are open at different hours.</p>

<p>Turkish women, independently of their
home baths, must resort at least once a month
to the public <i>hammam</i>. They like it for
many reasons, but principally because it is
the only place where they can meet to chat
over the news of the day and their family
affairs.</p>

<p>Some of these baths, especially the mineral
ones at Broussa, are of the finest description.
Gurgutly, containing the sulphureous
springs, is renowned for the remarkable efficacy
of its waters, its immense size, and the
elegant and curious style of its architecture.
It comprises two very large apartments, one
for the use of the bathers previous to their
entering the bath, the other the bath itself.
This is an immense room, with niches all
round containing fountains in the form of
shells, which receive part of the running
stream; in front of these are wooden platforms,
on which the bathers collect for the
purpose of washing their heads and scrubbing
their bodies. On the left, as you enter,
stands an immense marble basin, seven feet
in length and three in width, into which the
mother stream gushes with impetuous force.
From this it runs into a large round basin
about ten feet in depth, in which dozens of
women and children may be seen swimming,
an exhausting process, owing to the high
temperature of the water and its sulphureous
qualities. This wonderful basin is in the
shape of a reversed dome, sunk into the marble
floor, which is supported underneath by
massive columns.</p>

<p>Coffee-houses are to be met with everywhere,
and are very numerous in the towns.
The Turks resort to them when they leave
their homes early in the morning, to take a
cup of coffee and smoke a nargilé before going
to business. In the evening, too, they
step in to have a chat with their neighbors
and hear the news of the day. Turkish newspapers
have become pretty common of late
in these quiet rendezvous, and are to be
found in the most unpretending ones. Few
of these establishments possess an inviting
exterior or can boast any arrangements with
regard to comfort or accommodation; a few
mats placed upon benches, and a number of
common osier-seated chairs and stools, are
the seats afforded in them. Small gardens
may be found attached to some, while others
atone for the deficiencies of their interiors by
the lovely situations they occupy in this picturesque
and luxurious land.</p>

<p>There are more than twenty Imperial Palaces,
variously named, according to their
size and character, seraglios, yahlis, and kiosks,
scattered about Constantinople, some
on the Bosphorus, others inland, but all
equally to be admired as striking spectacles
of Eastern magnificence. Dolma-Bagché
and Beshiktash, linked with other mansions
and kiosks, mingling European architecture
with Oriental decoration, form a chain of
splendid palaces such as can be seen nowhere
but on the historic shores of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>The most renowned of the Ottoman palaces
was Eski Serai, on the point of land
where the Bosphorus enters the Sea of Marmora.
Built on the site of old Byzantium
by Mehemet II., this celebrated palace was
enlarged and beautified according to the
wants and caprices of each successive sultan.
It presented to the eye a crowded pile
of vast irregular buildings, crowned by gilded
cupolas and girt with shaded gardens. Beautiful
mosques, varied with hospitals and other
charitable foundations, were scattered about
in detached groups, amid clusters of stately
cypresses and the burial-grounds of kings.
Here might be seen a gorgeous pavilion, there
a cool jet, here again a mysterious building
with high impenetrable walls and latticed
windows, the monotonous dwelling-place of
bright young creatures who, once engaged,
were rarely permitted to regain their freedom.
And there, dwarfing all else, rose the
tall white minarets, accenting their clear outlines
against the tender sky of the East. In
this irregular confusion the artist saw one of
the choicest sights of the capital; and a
closer view offered to the curious a clear and
minute conception of the palace of an Eastern
despot.</p>

<p>All was there: the gorgeous and the
squalid, the refined and the loathsome, the
splendid state rooms of the Vicar of God,
beside the gloomy cages of those unhappy
princes, who, cursed by their royal blood,
were left to pine in solitude until death
came to settle accounts between them and
the tyrants who had doomed them to their
chains. There were the charitable establishments
whence the poor never turned away
unrefreshed,—and there the dungeon where
the powerful were left to starve and die.
There was the gilded kiosk where the Padishah
smoked his chibouk and issued his decrees,—whose
terrible ordinances were carried
out in the adjoining chamber-of-blood.
Beyond were the mausoleums of his race, lifting
up their rich adornment in the chill beauty
of the city of the dead—severed by a little
space from the scarcely more splendid dwellings
of the living. There lay those doomed
princes to whom a life without liberty and
ofttimes a cruel death were ill balanced by
the useless splendor of their tombs. “What
is the use of thy getting children,” once with
a mother’s bitterness said a Circassian slave
who had borne a son to one of the sultans,
“when they are only destined to people the
tombs?”</p>

<p>In later times Eski Serai was abandoned to
the use of the harems of deceased sultans, who
were sometimes shut up there for life. Its
last occupants, the multitudes of wives,
slaves, and odalisks belonging once to Sultan
Abdul-Medjid, unable any longer to endure
its dismal solitude, are reported to have set it
on fire in the hope of obtaining a dwelling
more congenial to the habits of comparative
liberty they had acquired. At all events the
palace was destroyed, and a vast number of
valuable and rare objects perished with it.
The site is now occupied by gardens, and a
railroad runs across it; the gem of the Golden
Horn has vanished.</p>

<p>Dolma-Bagché, built by Sultan Mahmoud
II., was a large wooden edifice. This and
Begler-Bey became the usual winter and summer
residences of the imperial family. Sultan
Abdul-Medjid, on coming to power, rebuilt
Dolma-Bagché and several other kiosks and
seraglios. Gentle, sensitive, refined, and loth
to shed blood, he is said to have evinced a superstitious
aversion to the old imperial palaces
whose splendor was tainted by the memory
of the crimes of his ancestors. He, and
still more his brother Adbul-Aziz, spent incalculable
sums in the erection and decoration
of seraglios. The latter’s yearly expenses
on this alone were reckoned to have
exceeded £580,000—one of the items which
ran away with the money which trusting or
speculative capitalists of Europe had been
foolish enough to supply for the future benefit
and improvement of Turkey (not, of
course, forgetting a slice in the pie for themselves),
but which has fallen somewhat short
of the end for which it was designed: Turkish
bondholders do not seem to consider
themselves of all men the most fortunate,
and Turkey itself has not gained by loading
its exchequer with a mountain of debt for
the sake of the reckless extravagance of imperial
luxury.</p>

<p>Holding a middle place between the great
palaces and the kiosks, the sultans of Turkey
possess <i>yahlis</i>, or villas, not less beautiful than
the mansions of greater pretensions. These
villas often rise on the shores of the Bosphorus
from a bed of verdure. Generally they
are closed and silent, with a solitary guard
standing sentinel at the gate; but every now
and then one of them may be seen lighted
up, as by magic, and teeming with life, with
the rumbling of carriages to and fro, and the
clashing of arms. At the sound of the trumpet
a strain of sweet music strikes up, and
the approach of a water-procession of caïques
swiftly gliding towards the gates announces
the arrival of the august master.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sultan goes alone to spend
a few hours of <i>dolce far niente</i>; at others he
makes an appointment with some special favorite
to meet him there. Abdul-Medjid’s
known partiality for Bessimé Sultana, the
most worthless but most beloved of his
wives, induced him on one occasion, while
on a visit to his Yahli at the sweet waters of
Asia, to send his own yacht for her in the
dead of night, alarming the whole seraglio by
its unexpected appearance at so unusual an
hour.</p>

<p>One of the three palaces most renowned
for beauty of architecture and magnificence
of furniture is Begler-Bey. It is worthy of
the use for which it has been selected, of being
the palace offered for the occupation of
illustrious foreign visitors. The arrangements
made in it for one imperial guest were
presided over by Sultan Abdul-Aziz in person,
and the private apartments of the illustrious
lady were perfect copies of those in
her own palace. The fastidiousness of the
host on this occasion was so great, that on
discovering that the tints on the walls and
furniture slightly differed from those he had
seen when on his European tour, he ordered
that everything should be removed and new
ones brought from Paris. The fair visitor is
said to have been equally surprised and flattered
by the delicate attention that had not
omitted even the smallest object of her toilette
table. The Sultan, in truly Oriental
fashion, caused a new pair of magnificent
slippers, embroidered with pearls and precious
stones, to be placed before her bed
every morning.</p>

<p>Since the time of Sultan Abdul-Medjid, the
furniture of the imperial palaces and kiosks
has been made to order in Europe. It is of so
costly a description as to be equal in value to
the edifices themselves. On entering Tcheragan,
and some of the other serails, the eye
is dazzled by the gilt decorations, gold and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
silver brocades, splendid mirrors and chandeliers,
and carved and inlaid furniture they
contain. In Abdul-Medjid’s time, clocks
and china vases were the only ornaments of
the apartments. The absence of pictures,
books, and the thousand different objects
with which Europeans fill their houses gave
the rooms, even when inhabited, a comfortless
and unused appearance.</p>

<p>Some years ago, when visiting the private
apartments of this Sultan, I noticed a splendid
antique vase. Lately, on speaking of
this priceless object to a seraglio lady, I was
informed that it had been thrown into the
Bosphorus by order of its owner. This act
of imperial extravagance was caused by the
supposition that the vase had been handled
by some person afflicted with consumption.</p>

<p>Sultan Abdul-Aziz, a year or two before
his dethronement, possessed with a nervous
terror of fire, caused all inflammable articles
to be taken out of the palaces, and replace
them by articles manufactured of iron. The
stores of fuel were cast into the Bosphorus,
and the lights of the Sultan’s apartments
were placed in basins of water. The houses
in the neighborhood of the Seraglio were
purchased by the Sultan, their occupants
forced to quit at a very short notice, their
furniture turned out, and the buildings pulled
down at once. These tyrannical precautions
served to heighten the general discontent of
the capital against the Padishah especially
among the poor, who justly complained that
they might have benefited by what had been
wasted; while some of the wealthy, though
not more contented, profited by the freak,
and carried off many of the rich objects taken
out of the palace.</p>

<p>The vast pleasure-grounds attached to the
seraglios are laid out with a tasteful care,
which, added to the beauty of the position
and the fertility of the soil, goes far to justify
the renown of the gardens of the Bosphorus.
The hills, valleys, and gorges that surround
them are covered with woods; here orchards
and vineyards, weighed down with their rich
burdens, lend color to the scene; there the
slopes are laid out in terraces, whose perpendicular
sides are clothed with the contrasted
shades of the sombre ivy-leaf and the bright
foliage of the Virginian creeper. Banks of
flowers carry the thoughts back to the hanging
gardens of Babylon. Nature and art
have ornamented these delightful spots with
lakes, fountains, cascades, aviaries, menageries,
and pavilions. “Here in cool grot”
every opportunity is offered for love-making,
and if this one is already engaged, there
are highly romantic nooks, concealed by
overhanging boughs, that will answer the
purpose as well. Trees and plants seem to
rejoice in the bright sunshine; the birds’
songs mingle strangely with the roar of the
wild beasts from which the Sultan is perhaps
trying to learn a lesson of humanity; and
gorgeous butterflies hover round, kissing the
sweet blossoms that fill the air with their
fragrance. Here the ladies of the harem,
when permitted to escape for a time from
their cages, roam at liberty like a troop of
school-girls during recreation hours, some
making for the orchards, others dispersing in
the vineyards, with screams of laughter and
wild frolic that would astonish considerably
any European garden party. The conservatories
and flower beds suffer terribly during
these incursions, and great is the despair of
the head-gardener.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A Seraglio, like all Moslem dwellings, is
divided into Haremlik and Selamlik. The
former is reserved for the family life of the
Sultan and his women; the latter is accessible
to officials who come to transact state
business with his Highness. The Mabeyn
consists of a number of rooms between the
two great divisions, and may be considered
the private home of the Sultan. It is here that
the Padishah resorts between nine and ten in
the morning, attired in his <i>gedjlik</i>, or morning
négligé; consisting of a <i>tekké</i>, or white
skull-cap; a bright-colored <i>intari</i> (dressing-gown)
and <i>eichdon</i> (trousers) of similar material;
a pair of roomy <i>terliks</i> (slippers), a <i>kirka</i>
(quilted jacket), or a <i>kirk</i> (pelisse lined with
fur), according to the season.</p>

<p>Thus attired, he resorts to his study and
gives his attention to state affairs, or to any
other occupations that suit his tastes and inclinations.
Close by are the apartments
where the gentlemen of the household, the
private secretaries, and other functionaries,
await their Imperial Master from sunrise.</p>

<p>An account I recently saw of the Imperial
expenditure estimated the annual outlay of
Sultan Abdul-Aziz at £2,000,000. The Palace
contained 5500 servants of both sexes.
The kitchens alone required 300 functionaries,
and the stables 400. There were also
about 400 caïkjis, or boatmen, 400 musicians,
and 200 attendants who had the charge of
the menageries and aviaries. Three hundred
guards were employed for the various palaces
and kiosks, and about 100 porters. The
harem, besides this, contained 1200 female
slaves.</p>

<p>In the Selamik might be counted from
1000 to 1500 servants of different kinds. The
Sultan had twenty-five “aides-de-camp,” seven
chamberlains, six secretaries, and at least
150 other functionaries, divided into classes,
each having its special employment.</p>

<p>One is intrusted with the care of the Imperial
wardrobe, another with the pantry,
a third with the making and serving of the
coffee, and a fourth with the pipes and cigarettes.</p>

<p>There were also numberless attendants
who carried either a torch, or a jug of perfumed
water for ablutions after a repast.
There is a chief barber, a superior attendant
who has special charge of the games of backgammon
and draughts, another superintends
the braziers, and there are at least fifty kavasses,
and one hundred eunuchs; and the
harem has also at its service a hundred servants
for going on errands and doing commissions
in Stamboul and Pera.</p>

<p>Altogether, the total number of the employés
of the Palace is about 5500. But this
is not all; these servants employ also other
persons beneath them, so that every day 7000
persons are fed at the expense of the Palace.
So great is the disorder in the organization
that the contractors claim five francs per
diem for the food of each of these 7000 persons,
which amounts to £511,000 per annum
for the employés only.</p>

<p>The various items comprise £1120 for
wood, £1040 for rice, and £16,000 for sugar.</p>

<p>The wages of employés included in the
civil list amounted to a total of £200,000,
exclusive of the salaries of aides-de-camp,
doctors, musicians, etc., which were paid by
the minister of war.</p>

<p>The stables of the Palace contained 600
horses, whose provender, according to the
estimates of the most reasonable contractors,
cost three Turkish liras per month, making a
total of about £20,000.</p>

<p>More than 200 carriages of every description
were kept in the palace. These were
for the most part presents from the Viceroy
of Egypt, but the expenses of the 150 coachmen
and footmen with their rich liveries are
paid by a civil list, also the harness-maker’s
accounts, and other items of this department.</p>

<p>The annual expenditure for pictures, porcelain,
etc., was never less than £140,000,
and in one year Sultan Abdul-Aziz spent
£120,000 for pictures only. As for jewels,
the purchases attained the annual sum of
£100,000, and the expenses of the harem for
presents, dresses, etc., absorbed £160,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>Besides these items, the allowances to the
mother and sisters of the Sultan, to his nephews
and nieces, and to the heir-apparent,
amounted to £181,760. This gives a total of
at least £1,300,000 annually. To this must
be added £80,000 for keeping in repair the
existing Imperial kiosks and palaces, and
£580,000 for the construction of new ones.
The Imperial revenue in the civil list was
£1,280,000. The expenditure was really
over £2,000,000.</p>

<p>I am unable to give an estimate of the expenses
of the seraglio of the present Sultan,
but I have been informed on good authority
that his Majesty personally superintends the
management of the palace, and regulates its
expenditure with great wisdom and economy;
it will take some time, however, to put an end
to the disorder, corruption, and irregularity
that have become so rooted in the whole system,
and caused the extravagance and waste
that prevailed in the households of former
sultans. A Turkish proverb says, “Baluk
bashtan kokar,” “The fish begins to decompose
at the head;” accordingly, if the head
be sound there is every hope that the body
will also keep fresh.</p>

<p>The haremlik of the Seraglio contains from
1000 to 1500 women, divided among the
Sultan’s household; that of his mother, the
Validé Sultana; and those of the princes.</p>

<p>This vast host of women of all ranks, ages,
and conditions are, without exception, of
slave extraction, originating from the cargoes
of slaves that yearly find their way to
Turkey from Circassia, Georgia, Abyssinia,
and Arabia, in spite of the prohibition of the
slave-trade. These slaves are sold in their
native land by unnatural relations, or torn
from their homes by hostile tribes, to be subsequently
handed over to the slave-dealers,
and brought by them into the capital and
other large towns. All these women are the
offspring of semi-barbarous parents, who seldom
scruple to sell their own flesh and blood.
Born in the hovel of the peasant or the hut
of the fierce chieftain, their first condition is
one of extreme ignorance and barbarism.
Possessed with the knowledge of no written
language, with a confused idea of religion
mixed up with the superstitious practices
that ignorance engenders; poorly clad, portionless,
and unprotected, they are drawn
into the seraglio by chains of bondage, and
go under the denomination of <i>Adjemis</i> (rustics).
No matter how low had been their starting-point,
their future career depends solely
upon their own good fortune. Their training
in the seraglio is regulated by the vocations
for which they are destined; those
chosen to fulfil domestic positions, such as
negresses and others not highly favored by
nature, are put under the direction of <i>kalfas</i>,
or head-servants, and taught their respective
duties.</p>

<p>The training they receive depends upon
the career to which their age, personal attractions,
and color entitle them. The
young and beautiful, whose lot has a great
chance of being connected with that of his
Imperial Majesty, or some high dignitary to
whom she may be presented by the Validé
or the Sultan as odalisk or wife, receives a
veneer composed of the formalities of Turkish
etiquette, elegance of deportment, the art
of beautifying the person, dancing, singing,
or playing on some musical instrument. To
the young and willing, instruction in the
rudiments of the Turkish language is given;
they are also initiated in the simpler forms of
Mohammedanism taught to women, such as
the <i>Namaz</i> and other prayers and the observance
of the fasts and feasts. Most of them
are, however, left to pick up the language as
best they can, and for this they display great
aptitude, and often succeed in speaking Turkish
with a certain amount of eloquence, although
their native accent is never lost, and
the extraction of a seraili can always be discovered
by her particular accent. Many of
these women possess great natural talent, and
if favored with some education, and endowed
with a natural elegance, become very tolerable
specimens of the fair sex.</p>

<p>All the seraglio inmates, on their entrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to the imperial abode, do not belong to this
class of <i>Adjemis</i>; many of them have been
previously purchased by Turkish hanoums of
high station, who, from speculative or other
motives, give them the training described,
and when sufficiently polished sell them at
high prices, or present them to the seraglio
with the view to some object.</p>

<p>An ex-seraili of my acquaintance had herself
undertaken this task and had offered as
many as fourteen young girls to the seraglio
of Abdul-Aziz, after having reared each for
the duties that would probably devolve upon
her. This lady said to me, “What other
gift from a humble creature like myself could
be acceptable to so great a personage as his
Imperial Majesty?” At the time this conversation
took place she had a fresh batch of
young slaves in hand. They were all smart-looking
girls, designated by fancy names
such as Amore, Fidèle, Rossignole, Beauté,
etc. Their dress was rich, but ludicrous in
the extreme, being composed of cast-off
seraglio finery of all the colors of the rainbow;
some children were even dressed in
the Turkish military uniform, which contrasted
strangely with the plaits of their long
thick hair tied up with cotton rags. Their
politeness, half saucy, half obsequious, was
very amusing; on entering the room they all
stood in a row at the lower end, and when
some jocose observations were made to them
by their mistress, a ready and half impudent
reply was never wanting. The youngest,
about eight years of age, was dressed in a
miniature colonel’s full uniform; on being
addressed by her owner by the name of
“<i>Pich</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and asked, “Will you have this
lady’s little son for your husband? I mean to
marry him to you when you grow up!” the
little miss laughed, and seemed perfectly
well acquainted with the meaning of the proposal,
and by no means abashed at it.</p>

<p>The treatment these girls received seemed
to be very kind, but sadly wanting in decency,
morality, and good principle.</p>

<p>On the accession of a new Sultan to the
throne, it was customary to make a clearance
of most of the inmates of the seraglio, and
replenish it with fresh ones, such as those
that already belonged to the household of the
new sovereign, and others further to augment
the number. Ottoman sultans, with two exceptions,
have never been known to marry;
the mates of the Sultan, chosen from among
the ranks of slaves already mentioned, or
from among those that are presented to him,
can only be admitted to the honorable title of
wife when they have borne children. The
first wife is called Bash Kadin Effendi, the
second Ikinji Kadin Effendi, and so on in
numerical order up to the seventh wife
(should there be so many), who would be
called Yedinji Kadin Effendi.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The slaves that have borne children beyond
this number bear the title of Hanoums,
and rank after the Kadin Effendis; their
children are considered legitimate, and rank
with the other princes and princesses. To
these two classes must be added a third, that
of favorites, who having no right to the title
of Kadin Effendi or Hanoum, are dependent
solely upon the caprice of their master or the
influence they may have acquired over him
for the position they hold in the imperial
household.</p>

<p>Under this system every slave in the seraglio,
from the scullery-maid to the fair and
delicate beauty purchased for her personal
charms, may aspire to attaining the rank of
wife, <i>odalisk</i>, or favorite. The mother of the
late Sultan Abdul-Aziz is said to have performed
the most menial offices in the establishment.
When thus engaged one day she
happened to attract the attention of her imperial
master, Sultan Mahmoud II., who distinguished
her with every mark of attention,
and raised her to the rank of Bash Kadin.
Generally speaking, however, the wives of
sultans are select beauties who are offered to
him yearly by the nation on the feast of Kandil
Ghedjessi, others are gifts of the Validé
and other persons wishing to make an offering
to the Sultan.</p>

<p>When one of these odalisks has succeeded
in gaining the good graces of the Sultan, and
attracted his attention, he calls up the Ikinji
Hasnadar Ousta,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and notifies to her his desire
of receiving the favored beauty into his
apartment. The slave, being informed of
this, is bathed, dressed with great care and
elegance, and introduced in the evening to
the imperial presence. Should she be so fortunate
as to find favor in the eyes of her lord
and master, she is on the next morning admitted
into a separate room reserved for
slaves of this category, which she occupies
during the time needful for ascertaining
what rank she is in future to take in the seraglio.
Should the arrival of a child raise her
to that of Kadin Effendi or hanoum, a <i>Dairé</i>,
or special apartment, is set apart for her.
Those who are admitted to the Sultan’s presence,
and have no claims to the rights of maternity,
do not present themselves a second
time unless requested to do so, nor can they
lay claim to any further attention, although
their persons, like those of the Kadin Effendi
and hanoums, become sacred, and the contraction
of marriage with another person is
unlawful. The distinction between the favored
and the discarded favorite is made
known by her abstaining from going to the
<i>hammam</i>. The lot of these discarded favorites
is naturally not an enviable one. Accidentally
noticed by the Sultan, or entertained
by him as the object of a mere passing caprice,
they seldom have the good fortune to
occupy a sufficient ascendency over the mind
or heart of the sovereign to enable them to
prolong or consolidate their influence.</p>

<p>A seraglio inmate, who had herself enjoyed
Imperial favor of this description, told
me that it was very seldom that a slave enjoyed
more than once the passing notice of
the Sultan, a disappointment naturally very
deeply felt by those who after being suddenly
raised to the height of favor find themselves
quickly consigned again to oblivion,
in which their future is passed. There are
many among the rejected favorites who have
sensitive natures and are capable of a serious
attachment, and in consequence of the sarcasms
the more favored fail not to heap upon
them, the disappointment they have experienced,
or the devouring jealousy that unrequited
love occasions, are said to become broken-hearted
or die of consumption. “Nor,”
continued my informant, “was the condition
of those more closely connected with the
Sultan such as insured to them perfect happiness,
mental unconcern, or security.”</p>

<p>They are obliged to have recourse to every
art to preserve their beauty, fight hard
against the attacks and intrigues of rivals,
and carefully to watch over themselves and
their offspring.</p>

<p>Bessimé Sultana, one of the few who obtained
a right to that title by marriage, was
an emancipated slave, adopted by the lady
who had brought her up, and consequently
could not be possessed by Sultan Abdul-Medjid
unless through <i>Nekyah</i>, or legal marriage.</p>

<p>In relating her strange and adventurous
life, as one of the Kadin Effendis, to a personal
friend of mine, she said, Nothing can
give a clear idea of the intrigues and cabals
perpetually carried on within the walls of
the seraglio. The power and happiness of
some contrast strangely with the trials and
sufferings of those who are in the power of
the influential and malicious. Every crime
that has a chance of being silently passed
over can be committed by these.</p>

<p>The slave who, by her interesting position,
becomes entitled to the use of separate apartments,
receives a pension, has her own
slaves, her eunuchs, her doctors, banker,
carriages, and caïques, and is supplied with
apparel, jewels, and all other requisites suited
to her rank. She dines in her own rooms,
receives her friends, and goes out when allowed
to do so. On attaining this rank a
new world, dazzling with gold, luxury, and
every refinement belonging to the favored
and elevated is opened to her, raising her far
above her former companions in toil and
frolic, who in future, setting aside all familiarity,
stand before her with folded arms,
kiss the hem of her garment, and obey her
orders with profound respect.</p>

<p>The favored beauty fulfils the duties of
her new position with the elegance, dignity,
and <i>savoir faire</i> of an enchanted being, who,
accustomed to the distant perspective of the
fairy-land which has been the one object of
her dreams, suddenly attains it, and feels at
home. Her single aim in life is now to preserve
those charms which have caused her
elevation.</p>

<p>In Sultan Abdul-Medjid’s time, blue-eyed,
delicate beauties with golden hair were the
most admired by the Sultan; fair beauties
consequently became extremely <i>recherchées</i>,
and the grand ladies of the capital vied with
each other in their assiduity in finding out
and educating them, in order to present them
to the seraglio. By degrees the taste for
<i>Laypisca</i>, or golden locks, became so general
in Turkish society as to make the fortune of
many a Pera perruquier, who sold for a guinea
the tiny bottle of fluid that changed the dusky
hair into golden tresses, whilst the ladies paid
the penalty of its abuse in the injury done
to their eyes and the nervous maladies contracted
by its use. Besides this, all the seraglio
ladies indulged to a great extent in paint,
rouge, and <i>rastuk</i> (antimony) for the eyes
and eyebrows.</p>

<p>A French proverb says, “La femme est
un animal qui s’habille, babille et se barbouille.”
If this can be applied to any particular
class of womankind, it is surely to the
inhabitants of the fairy-land I have attempted
to describe.</p>

<p>The Validé Sultana, or mother of the Sultan,
ranks first in the seraglio; one of the
wings of the palace nearest to that occupied
by her son is set apart for her use. She possesses
state apartments, has an innumerable
train of slaves, and every mark of attention
is paid her not only by the Sultan, but also
by all the high functionaries of the Porte,
who at times have more to dread from her
influence and interference than from the Sultan
himself. The other members of the Imperial
family rank next by courtesy, but
these are all under the direct control of the
Hasnadar Ousta, or superintendent, who,
with her assistant, the second Hasnadar Ousta,
attends to all the wants of each department,
regulates their internal administration,
and acts as go-between of the Sultan and his
wives when they have any request to make
to him, or when he has orders to give respecting
them; she also regulates the receptions
and ceremonies as well as the expenses.
Some of her duties are of the most delicate,
difficult, and responsible nature, and require
a great amount of judgment and experience.
The person appointed to this important post
is generally the favorite slave of the Validé.</p>

<p>Very few of the seraglio inmates, except
young princesses and other children that are
brought up from their infancy in it, possess
any knowledge of writing, or have had the
advantage of regular training. All started in
life from the same condition: chance alone
settles the difference between the wife, odalisk,
favorite, and Imperial mother, and
draws a line between them and their luckless
sisters left to the exercise of menial functions.</p>

<p>Education, much neglected as yet among
Turkish women, has made very little progress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
in the seraglio, where it would prove
an invaluable aid to those destined to hold
the responsible positions of wives and mothers
of Sultans. If the former, instead of being
chosen as they are from a host of human
beings chained to the service of a single individual,
with the sole object of amusing his
leisure hours, attending to his wants, and
giving him the progeny that is to succeed
him on the throne, were selected, as in other
countries, from among educated ladies, and
their number fixed (or reduced to one) by the
laws of religion and civilization, how different
would seraglio life be! Dignity and esteem
would replace humiliation; woman, elevated
to her true sphere, would exercise her
influence for high and noble objects, instead
of the unworthy purposes which she effects
through the only channel left open to her.</p>

<p>Under such a system it will not be surprising
to hear of vice and corruption prevailing
in a centre where virtue is crushed, and the
benefits of sound education are neither acquired
nor appreciated. The correctness of
this statement, which may appear severe, can
only be understood and appreciated by those
who have come in contact with inmates of
the seraglio, and are well acquainted with
the language, manners, and customs of the
Turks. Such persons would have no hesitation
in admitting that exceptions are to be
found in the seraglio, as well as in the rest of
Turkish society. The class which is in the
minority consists of those naturally gifted
natures, to be met with in this country as elsewhere,
who possess virtues that yield not to
the influences of temptation and vice, and become
ladies in the true sense of the word.
The real Turkish Hanoum, or lady, is a dignified,
quiet person, elegant, sensible, and
often naturally eloquent, condescending and
kind to those who gain her good-will, proud
and reserved to those who do not merit her
esteem. Her conversational resources are certainly
limited, but the sweetness and poetry
of the language she uses, the pretty manner
in which her expressions are worded, and the
spirited repartee that she can command have
a charm that atones for her limited knowledge.
Her manners, principles, and choice of
language offer a pleasant contrast to those
prevalent among the generality, and render
her society extremely agreeable.</p>

<p>There is another class of serailis who present
a not less interesting study. Sensitive
and refined, fragile and dreamy in appearance,
gifted perhaps with virtues they have no occasion
to exercise, or with strong and passionate
feelings that in a seraglio can never find
vent in a solid and healthy affection, they become
languid and spiritless, verging towards
decline, to which they fall victims, unless released
(as occasionally happens) by being set
free and married.</p>

<p>Another class of serailis is the independent
set, who are denominated Deli Serailis,
or wild serailis, famous for their extravagant
ideas, disorderly conduct, and unruly disposition;
endowed with the bump of cunning
and mischief, joined to a fair amount of energy
and vivacity, they carry out, in spite
of high walls and the watchful surveillance
of more than a hundred eunuchs, all the
wicked plans and mad freaks their disorderly
minds and impulsive natures suggest to them;
their language, manners, and actions are
such as no pen can describe. In the reign of
Sultan Abdul-Medjid, the misconduct and
extravagance of this set had reached its climax,
and attracted the attention even of that
indulgent sovereign, who was induced to order
the expulsion of the most notorious. A
few of them were exiled, others given in
marriage, by Imperial order, to some dependants
of the palace, who received official
appointments or were sent into the interior.
These unfortunate men, burdened with their
uncongenial helpmates, were but inadequately
compensated by the rich gifts they received
at the same time. During a long residence
in the interior of Turkey, I became personally
acquainted with a number of these
ladies. One of them, a stout, coarse-looking
woman, would not even deign to show that
outward appearance of respect required from
every Turkish woman towards her husband.
She was the wife of a sub-governor, in whose
house I passed a day and night; she was
gay and of a sociable disposition, but evidently
not much attached to her husband,
whom she designated as <i>Bezim Kambour</i> (my
hen-pecked one), and to whom she addressed
invectives of a very violent nature, accompanied,
as I was subsequently informed, by
corporal chastisement.</p>

<p>A second seraili, worthy of mention, was
a thin Circassian brunette, married to a governor-general
of high rank. She had a propensity,
rather unusual amongst Turkish
women, to an abuse of strong drinks, and she
and her boon companions indulged in this
excess to such a degree as to shock and scandalize
the Mohammedan portion of the inhabitants
wherever she went.</p>

<p>The other serailis of this class were so
strange and extravagant in their manners,
and their actions had made them so notorious,
that details of their freaks would be as unedifying
to the public as painful to me to describe.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I frequented this
class of serailis as little as the <i>convenances</i> of
society permitted, but, on the other hand,
experienced great pleasure in associating with
the serailis that belonged to the respectable
class, in whose society, conversing upon seraglio
life, I have spent many a pleasant
hour.</p>

<p>The amusements in the Imperial palace depend
very much upon the tastes and disposition
of the reigning sovereign, whose pleasure
in such matters is naturally first consulted.
In the days of Sultan Abdul-Medjid
these amusements daily received some increase
in the shape of European innovations.
A theatre of great beauty was built in one of
the palaces, by order of the Sultan, and a
European company of actors played pieces,
which the ladies were allowed to witness from
behind lattices. Ballet-dancing, for which
the Sultan evinced great partiality; conjurors
of European celebrity; the Turkish Kara
Guez, or Marionettes; <i>al fresco</i> entertainments,
etc., were among the entertainments.
Shopping in the streets of Pera was not the
least appreciated of their amusements. The
French shopkeeper himself played as prominent
a part in the matter as the perfumes
and finery he displayed and sold. There
were also delightful garden-parties, when the
seraglio grounds would be lighted up with
variegated lanterns and fireworks, and all
that the Palace contained of youth and beauty
turned out; some, dressed as young pages,
would act the part of Lovelace, and make
love to their equally fair companions, dressed
in light fancy costumes; others, grouped together,
would perform on musical instruments
or execute different dances; others,
again, seated in light caïques, with costumes
so transparent and airy as to show every
muscle of their bodies, and with flowing hair
to preserve their white necks from the evening
dew, would race on the still waters of the
lakes.</p>

<p>The Sultanas and hanoums, seated on carpets,
beguiling the time by drinking sherbets,
eating fruits and ices, and smoking cigarettes,
would gaze on the scene, while strains
of music and the notes of the Shaiki (songs)
would be heard in all directions. All, however,
both slaves and ladies, were similarly
occupied with one sole object—that of rendering
the scene pleasant and beauteous to the
lord and master for whom it was designed.
All would redouble their life and animation
as the Sultan listlessly approached each group,
acknowledging its presence with a sweet
smile, a gentle word, or a passing caress,
which he never withheld even when all the
faculties of enjoyment were destroyed, and
his earthly paradise of houris had become an
object of indifference.</p>

<p>During the reign of his successor the tone
of the seraglio became more serious and the
life of its inmates more constrained; there
was less European amusement and more Turkish;
such as a Turkish theatre, whose actors
and actresses, Turkish and Armenian, performed
Turkish pieces, with a certain amount
of success, such as the <i>Meydan Oyoun</i>, a
coarse kind of comedy, and other representations
of a similar character.</p>

<p>A child born in the seraglio is allowed to
remain under the care of its mother, who,
with the assistance of a wet-nurse and several
under-nurses, has charge of its infantile
wants up to the age of seven. The wet-nurse
is generally sent for from Circassia. On entering
upon her duties as foster-mother, she
is entitled to special attention, and exercises
great influence over her charge. Her own
child is received as <i>Sut Kardash</i>, or foster-brother,
of the Imperial offspring, and enjoys
the privilege of becoming his playmate and
companion. The two children, as they grow
up together, never lose sight of one another,
the fortune of the one being assured in right
of the privilege of having drawn its nourishment
from the same source as the other.</p>

<p>I obtained these details from a Pasha of high
rank, who had himself the honor of being
foster-brother to one of the Sultans: he said,
“Before I saw the light, my mother was
sent for from Circassia, and my birth, which
took place in the seraglio, preceded that of
his Imperial Majesty by a few weeks. As I
grew up, the prosperity of my family, due to
Imperial bounty, was not limited to my
mother and myself, but extended to my father
and the rest of my relatives, who were
brought to Constantinople, and enriched with
grants of wealth, rank, and position.” The
results, however, of these ties are not always
so favorable to the Imperial prince as to those
who owe their all to his generosity. These
persons, being of humble origin, on finding
themselves suddenly raised to a higher
sphere, do not possess the necessary qualification
for making a good and judicious use
of the influence they thus acquire. The foster-mother
of Sultan Abdul-Aziz was notorious
for her rapacity and spirit of intrigue;
she had, by degrees, acquired such ascendency
in the seraglio as to have it in her power to
appoint or dismiss, at her will, governors-general
and other important personages.
One of her special protégés, on being informed
that he was about to be transferred
from his post as Governor-General of a vilayet
of R⸺, smiled calmly, and said to me, “So
long as the Sultan’s foster-mother is there to
protect my interests, I am in no danger of
that! The attempt made to remove me will
cost a little money, that is all!”</p>

<p>The training of the Imperial child is not
free from the many drawbacks that attend
other Turkish children. From its earliest infancy,
left in the hands of fond but weak and
uneducated women, the child becomes wayward,
capricious, and difficult to please.</p>

<p>This lenient treatment of the infant is continued
in the more advanced stages of its life,
and seriously retards its education. At this
period Imperial princes and princesses command
absolute attention, obedience, and respect
from the legion of menials that surround
them, who, anxious to lay the foundations
of future favoritism, refuse nothing in
their power, and pamper their vanity and
precocious ideas to such an extent as to destroy
in great part the effects of the teaching
they receive, often rendering profitless the
instruction given them in morality and good
principle.</p>

<p>The knowledge generally acquired by
Turkish princes was formerly limited to the
study of Arabic, and the Persian, Turkish,
and French languages, with other branches
of the general Turkish education, but the
harem indolence, and the maternal and paternal
indulgence, sadly interrupt the course
of their lessons, which are gone through in a
most negligent manner, and fail to have their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
due effect upon the young mind that pursues
them with little assiduity.</p>

<p>The education of the young princesses is
still more deficient, both in the substance of
the teaching and in the manner and time in
which it is undertaken. An elementary
knowledge of their native language, of music,
and needlework, given at leisure and received
at pleasure, is considered quite sufficient.
These girls, on attaining the age of fifteen
or sixteen, are richly portioned, receive the
gift of a splendid trousseau, jewelry, and a
palace, and are married to some court favorite.
In consequence of their high birth, and
the precedence they have over their husbands,
these princesses are very independent, and
absolute mistresses in their households.</p>

<p>Few of the married princesses in the reigns
of the more recent Sultans enjoyed good reputations,
or acquired public esteem, or even the
affection of their husbands. Wayward and
extravagant in their habits, tyrannical, and
often cruel, their treatment of their little-to-be-envied
spouses furnished cause for endless
gossip to the society of Stamboul. The few
princesses who formed exceptions to this rule
are still remembered with affection by the
numerous dependants of their establishments.</p>

</div>

<p>The sanitary and protective laws of Turkey
are in their application still very primitive,
although of late years they have been
revised and reorganized, and a municipality
and district police corps have been formed.
The carrying out of these new laws was intrusted
to a regular administration, having
its chief seat at Constantinople, with branches
in all the provincial towns, and it has done
good service in the capital itself, for many
of the improvements that have been made
there are due to the efforts of the municipality.</p>

<p>In other towns, however, its good influence,
though well paid for by the inhabitants has
hitherto been little felt. The streets continue
to be ill-paved, and but dimly lighted with
petroleum; sanitary measures are neglected;
immense heaps of refuse are piled upon pieces
of waste ground and stray spots, and are left
to decompose by the action of the air, be devoured
by unclean animals, or float away on
some small stream of water. Enough, however,
remains in the streets and in the vicinity
of towns and villages to pollute the air
and cause intermittent fever. Fortunately
the climate is naturally salubrious, and the
public health, taken on an average, is good.
Some districts are considered very unhealthy,
but the fault lies with the municipality of the
place, who, when they become more intelligent
and active, may perhaps attend less to
their own interests and more to those of the
public. Besides the above-mentioned innovations
of the <i>Beledié</i>, or municipality, small
portions of pavement, two or three feet in
length, are now and then constructed, professing
to be the commencement of a magnificent
pavement that is to traverse the town;
but alas! after a few weeks the work is
abandoned, and these short lengths of footpath
are left isolated in the midst of pools of
mud and water, which can only be crossed by
using the boulders scattered here and there as
stepping-stones.</p>

<p>Sometimes a number of scavengers may be
seen doing duty in the streets, or carting
away the rubbish collected in the town; but
they only convey it to the quay, where it is
left for the ragged Jews and other beggars to
explore.</p>

<p>The defects of the police were far more
serious and more deeply felt throughout Turkey
than those of the municipality. The
police were insufficient as a protective force.
They were badly organized, and they showed
an utter want of principle, honesty, and
morality. The deplorable condition of this
corps, and the oppressive and illegal influence
it exerted over the people, gave rise to
great public indignation, and induced the
people to complain loudly against it.</p>

<p>Ali and Fuad Pashas, well aware of the
grievance, were the first to attempt a thorough
police reform. By their united efforts a regular
corps was formed, more numerous, better
conditioned, better paid, clad in uniform,
and classified as follows:</p>

<p>(1.) The <i>Kavasses</i>, doing duty in the capital
and attached to embassies and other
foreign offices.</p>

<p>(2.) The <i>Seymen</i>, doing police duty at
Constantinople.</p>

<p>(3.) The <i>Zaptiehs</i>, foot police for the service
of the district administration.</p>

<p>(4.) The <i>Soubaris</i>, mounted police, charged
with the superintendence of public safety;
with the office of receiving the taxes from the
villages and transmitting them to the authorities;
and with the duty of accompanying
overland mails, travellers, etc.</p>

<p>(5.) The <i>Bekchis</i>, or rural police, placed at
the Beklemés or guard-houses on all the
main roads.</p>

<p>(6.) The <i>Teftish</i>, or detectives.</p>

<p>The uniform worn by the Kavasses consists
of a black cloth coat and trousers,
braided with gold, a belt, and a formidable-looking
Turkish sword and pistol. That of
the detectives is similar, but they carry no
arms. The rest of the police wear a uniform
similar to that of the Zouaves, of dark blue
<i>shayak</i>, braided and turned up with red, a
black leather belt and a cutlass. The Soubaris
have long guns, and all wear the fez.
The officers’ uniform is similar to that of the
officers’ in the army. The arms are supplied
by the Government, and a new suit of clothes
allowed every year.</p>

<p>When this body was first organized, some
attention was paid to enrolling in it men of
respectable character. The increase of pay
and the regularity of the pay-days gave it for
some time a better name than the old force;
but, unfortunately, hardly had the people begun
to feel the benefit of the changes created
during the reform fever, than these were set
aside to make room for the economical mania
that took possession of the administration
on the formation of a new ministry. This
latest epidemic, of the many that have attacked
Turkey, was fatal to the provincial
administration in general, and affected the police
in particular. Their numbers were reduced,
and pay diminished, and irregularly
distributed. The guard-houses on the highways,
which had been established at the distance
of four miles from each other, and intrusted
to <i>Bekchis</i>, who were held responsible
for the security of their districts, were abandoned
and fell into ruin, or were occupied by worthless
fellows who undertook the duty for
a small recompense, which proving difficult
to obtain, these so-called “guards” were
compelled to make up their financial deficits
as best they could.</p>

<p>I heard of a fellow of this kind who had
taken the post of Bekchi in a mountain pass
as a chiplak, or tattered Albanian, but who
after a year had passed was the owner of 700
goats and a fine house, and was dressed in all
the glory of his national costume.</p>

<p>How did he obtain it? is a question not
easily answered if put to a great many of his
class. I do not, myself, find the problem
difficult of solution. These amateur guards
would seem to be the connecting link between
the police and the brigands; if, indeed,
any such link were needed.</p>

<p>Conversing, some time ago, with some
highly educated Bulgarians, well versed in the
affairs of their country, I was told that the
chief causes of the discontent of their nation
were the increase of the taxes, the harshness
with which the payment was enforced upon
them by the district officials, the extortion of
the police, and the robberies and crimes committed
by the Circassians. The people complained
most bitterly of the insolent arrogance
of the police, which they declared
drove them to desperation, and made them
ready to listen to any one who promised release,
rather than continue to submit longer
to such evils. There are, of course, some
honest men in the police force who are ready
to do their duty, but the generality are unquestionably
immoral and unscrupulous, and,
even if they were honest, their number is too
small for the protection of the millions who
depend upon them for their safety.</p>

<p>From time immemorial brigandage has
played so prominent a part in both the political
and social condition of Turkey that a
description of life in this country would be
incomplete without a few words about this
lucrative profession.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the time, which may still
be remembered by some of the oldest inhabitants,
when brigands, mustering in overwhelming
forces, composed of degenerate
janissaries and malcontents from all the provinces
of European Turkey, gathered under
chieftains like Passvan Oglou and Ali Pasha
of Joannina, defied the authority of the
Porte, ravaged and devastated whole provinces,
besieged towns, spread terror and
bloodshed on every side, and left behind
them nothing but misery and tears. The
Greek Klephts were not more renowned for
their bravery and patriotism than for the
ravages and crimes they committed during
and after the war of Greek independence.</p>

<p>Since that time great changes have taken
place in Turkey, and brigandage lost its ancient
power. The thousands that filled its
ranks have, in our day, been reduced to tens.
But the evil though deprived of its force,
and even entirely eradicated in some parts of
the country, has not been wholly suppressed.</p>

<p>Of late years, in Turkey, brigandage has
ceased to clothe itself in the garb of politics;
it is now represented merely by bands of cut-throats
belonging to all creeds and nationalities.
The chiefs, however, and the backbone
of these bands, are Albanians. The
number is made up by Greeks, Turks, and
Bulgarians. The Mussulman Albanian takes
to brigandage because he likes it, and willingly
makes a profession of it; the others join
in order to evade justice, or to avoid want
and misery, or simply to respond to the dictates
of a vicious and criminal disposition.
It is generally in early spring, when the trees
have lost their nakedness and the hedges are
covered with green leaves and sweet-smelling
blossoms, that this element of infamy and
destruction makes its appearance, taking to
the highway or lurking for its prey among
the hills and valleys, and polluting with its
blood-stained feet the freshness and purity of
resurgent nature. Its victims may often be
found lying dead on a bed of violets or lilies,
gazed upon by the wild rose that hangs its
head and seems to blush for man’s outrage.
Such sights are of every-day occurrence.</p>

<p>The brigands have associates living in the
towns with every appearance of respectability,
who furnish them with timely notice
when and where a good piece of business can
be done. They have spies who give them
warning when danger is at hand, and they
often find protectors in high places to help
them to escape the arm of the law. As for
food, the flocks of the terror-stricken Christian
shepherds are at their mercy, and the
peasant, trembling for the safety of his home,
dares not refuse to satisfy them with bread
and wine. He dares not give notice to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
authorities of the presence of those marauders,
as that would expose him to their vengeance,
and he would pay for his temerity with his
life. But should the authorities suspect a
countryman of having furnished provision or
other necessaries to the brigands, he is forthwith
prosecuted and cast into prison as their
associate and a participator in their spoils.
These are the causes that breed and rear brigandage
in Turkey in defiance of laws and
of the power of the authorities. The police
regulations, theoretically excellent, are practically
useless, and may be looked upon as
one of the principal reasons of the continuance
of brigandage, a scourge on the inhabitants
and a disgrace to the administration.</p>

<p>When a band of brigands has taken up its
quarters in a district, the country round is continually
kept on the <i>qui vive</i> by its repeated
crimes and depredations. A force of <i>Soubaris</i>
(mounted police) is sent in chase, but
the laxity with which their duty is generally
discharged, the neglect of proper precautions
to insure success, and the usual futile termination
of such expeditions, are often caused
by unwillingness to risk a dangerous encounter,
or by interested motives for letting off
the brigands.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, on the other hand, suffer
in any case by the pursuit, for, when it
proves fruitless, it does not save them from
danger, and only aggravates the enemy; and
when the chase is successful, the expenses
of having these armed men and their horses
quartered upon them, besides the suspicions
and injuries to which they are often exposed
under the pretence of having direct or indirect
communication with the brigands, are
so great as to render the remedy almost
worse than the evil, and induce them to petition
the authorities to withdraw the Soubaris
sent for their protection.</p>

<p>If these policemen are headed by an honest
and courageous chief, as occasionally happens,
and he sets to work earnestly to do his
duty, success is almost certain, and the brigands
are either captured, destroyed, or dispersed.
Those who are caught are disarmed,
handcuffed, and, if numerous and of a desperate
character, chained in couples and
marched off to prison. Still the hardy freebooters
are not dispirited, for if they are
wealthy, or the proofs of their crime are not
transparently clear, their chances of escape,
especially in the interior, are not small, and
bribery affords them a ready means of regaining
their liberty.</p>

<p>When brigands disperse or retire in winter
from the field of action, they find shelter
in a well-protected refuge. Such places are
easily found in the country <i>chiftliks</i> of influential
beys, who, from motives of self-preservation
or ignorance of their guests’ antecedents,
allow their Albanian guards to harbor
the malefactors who venture to seek shelter
under their roof.</p>

<p>The severe laws formerly existing in Turkey
for the punishment of crime, whereby
mutilation was ordained in certain cases, are
no longer in use. Crime, according to its
extent and the circumstances that surround
it, is punishable by imprisonment for a certain
period, or condemnation to death; the
sentence, however, is seldom put into execution
except in very bad cases, or when the
authorities are desirous of making an example
of severity in the town. When a long
and careful procedure has taken place before
both the civil and religious courts, the Kadi
decrees the sentence, which must be presented
to the Sultan for his sanction before
it can be carried out. The culprit is strung
up to some shop-front in the most frequented
part of the bazar, or decapitated, and his
head exposed, sometimes for three days, in
the market-place.</p>

<p>I have heard many stories of the outrages of
brigands during my long residence in remote
and semi-barbarous parts of the country. I
have even been in close contact with some,
and on a friendly footing, and once escaped
from their pursuit only thanks to the swiftness
of a powerful horse. On two other occasions,
yielding to necessity and in the interests
of self-preservation, I accepted the
services of two or three Albanians who were
suspected of being cut-throats, instead of the
Government escort.</p>

<p>They were fine, hardy fellows, with deep
scars on their faces, that attested the lease
upon which they held their life and the manner
in which they had disputed it with
others. They were reputed to be as venturesome
in crime as they were ready to sacrifice
their lives, if need were, for the preservation
of those intrusted to their care. I penetrated
into deep gorges with these men, and stopped
in isolated and ill-reputed khans, and
throughout the night slept as securely as if
I had been in my own home. The worst of
men, like the wildest of beasts, has his good
side; the secret of finding this out lies in
striking the right chord; put the Albanian
on his honor, and he will never desert you or
betray your trust.</p>

<p>The attacks made by brigands vary according
to the locality, the nature of the enterprise,
and the result desired. Should the attack
be upon a caravan of peasants returning
home from market or elsewhere, they are
waylaid, stripped of all they possess, cruelly
beaten, wounded, and sometimes killed.
When the assault is directed against a person
that has been singled out for them either for
his wealth or other purposes, the assault
made upon him and his escort is always of a
murderous nature, terminating in the inflictions
of cruel wounds or death.</p>

<p>The long gun of the Albanian or the yataghans
of his equally dreaded companions are
ever suspended over the heads or the wealthy
Chorbadjis: when the slightest opportunity
is afforded they assault the villages,
rob, murder, and carry off hostages in the persons
of young men or boys—the sons of people
who are sufficiently wealthy to redeem them
by the payment of large ransoms.</p>

<p>Such attacks are of not unfrequent occurrence,
especially in troubled times, when the
ends of justice are rarely attained in the punishment
of the criminals or the recovery of
lost property.</p>

<p><i>Kheradjis</i>, the brave and trustworthy fellows
who undertake to convey the goods of
the merchants from town to town on the
backs of their horses and mules, and the
Tatar couriers, who are intrusted with the
transport of sums of money, are great temptations
to brigands. The last attack on a
Kheradji I heard of took place last summer
when he and his companion, an Albanian
Mohammedan, had quitted one of the smaller
towns in the Vilayet of Salonika, conveying
a considerable sum of money concealed in the
sacks of corn with which his animals were
laden. While on the road, and a short distance
from their destination, they were suddenly
attacked by two brigands, who
wounded the Christian Kheradji, and, after
a struggle, succeeded in disarming the Mohammedan.
They then searched the persons
of the two men, and not finding the
expected booty proceeded to cut open the
sacks and abstract the money, after which
they made off, leaving the unfortunate Kheradjis
to find their way back to the town they
had left, and to which both were strangers.</p>

<p>Next morning the Albanian presented himself
before the Medjliss, or local court, to
deposit his complaint; on looking round he
started, and pointing to one of the members
of the Bench exclaimed, “By Allah and Mohammed,
I swear that here is one of the two brigands,
that attacked us yesterday! If any
one doubts my word let this man’s house be
searched, and a jacket with a torn sleeve will
be found, to attest the truth of my accusation!”
The culprit, in the midst of the general
surprise and confusion, made his escape.
Search was made in his house, and the jacket
described by the Kheradji found, but the
owner has not since been heard of.</p>

<p>Another robbery of a far more daring and
serious nature was attempted by a gang of
Albanians in the autumn of 1876 in the town
of Vodena. The assailants, seven in number,
had been frequently noticed lurking in
the woods and gardens that lie in the beautiful
plain by which this picturesque town is
surrounded. The brigands had marked out
the house of one of the wealthy Chorbadjis
as the object of their attack. This man possessed
a certain amount of education, and
had taken the precaution of building a house
sufficiently solid to protect himself and family
and to secure his treasure. The building
was not large but well protected, and surrounded
by a large court-yard with high walls
and a strong gate. The house-door was very
solid, and furnished with triple bolts; and
the windows, opening on a veranda, were
well barred. The robbers, having planned
their attack and posted a sentinel at the only
open end of the street, proceeded to attack
the gate. Finding it impossible to break it
open, they undermined it, and entered the
yard. The first barrier thus passed, and persuaded
that an attempt on the house-door
would prove fruitless, they placed a ladder
which they found against the veranda, supposing
that where the Chorbadji and his wife
slumbered there would their treasure be.
They set to work at the window of this
chamber, attempting to demolish the iron
bars.</p>

<p>The night was dark and stormy and the
rain fell heavily, but the unconscious slumberers
were not awakened for some time. At
length the wife of the Chorbadji, startled by
the unaccustomed noise at the window,
aroused her husband and acquainted him
with what was going on. His coolness and
courage were quite equal to the occasion, and
after a short consultation with his wife he decided
upon using the fire-arms that hung
against the wall. It was a terrible moment
for both. Standing a little on one side, and
protected by the darkness of the room, they
could see several men trying to force the
bars. To face these men openly was certain
death, and it was hard to get a good aim at
them. He decided finally to attempt a shot,
first calling out in a determined voice, “Who
goes there? Let him leave the spot, or he is
a dead man!”</p>

<p>This appeal, however, instead of having
the desired effect, stimulated the energy of
the brigands, who, forming into two bands,
now attacked the door of the house as well,
and were making strenuous efforts to open
it. The Chorbadji, cautiously advancing towards
the side of the window, and screened
by the projecting walls, fired his pistol and
shot one of the Albanians dead who stood on
the ladder; another mounted, and a second
shot stretched him wounded on the floor of
the veranda. The rest, whose shots into the
room proved ineffective, abandoned the window
and went to the door, at which they continued
pounding with the fury of fiends, but
as yet to no effect.</p>

<p>In the mean time the brave couple, freed
from the immediate vicinity of their enemies,
struck a light, and while the husband was
pouring his fire upon them the wife loaded
his pistols. A girl who slept in the next room
opened her window and called loudly for
help, but was nearly paying for her rashness
with her life, as one of the brigands in the
yard fired at her, and the ball struck the iron
bar against which her head was pressed, but
glanced off.</p>

<p>The Albanians, after some further efforts,
began to fear the consequences of the alarm
the affray was beginning to excite in the
neighborhood, and bethought themselves of
making good their retreat. But previously
to doing so they cut off the head of their
dead comrade to avoid detection, and carried
it away with them, together with their
wounded. A few weeks subsequently the
assault was renewed, but the owner was well
prepared to receive and repel it, without,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
however, being able to obtain definite peace
and security for his home.</p>

<p>The Albanians, doubly incensed against
him for the loss of their comrade and their
disappointment at not having been able to
effect their purpose, sent threatening messages
to the Chorbadji, and claimed 160<i>l.</i> for
the widow and children of the slain brigand,
or in lieu thereof himself to pay the debt
with his life. The poor man, being hard
pressed, appealed to the Kaimakam, or sub-governor
of the town, for protection; but
this dignitary, being an Albanian, old and
void of energy, and incapable of bringing
the culprits to justice, offered his services as
peacemaker between the two parties, and
proposed a compromise for half that sum.
The Chorbadji refused to pay anything, and
the Albanians renewed their threats. The
persecuted man in the mean time had to remain
in-doors on the pretext of ill-health, and
only expects to be able to regain his liberty
when affairs settle and better times come.</p>

<p>Among the many sad cases of children and
youths being carried off from the villages,
which have become so prevalent during these
disordered times, I may relate one which happened
last year, in the district of Caterina,
at the foot of Mount Olympus. The victim
was a fine promising young Greek of two-and-twenty,
an only son, doted upon by a grief-stricken
mother, whose husband had been
killed by brigands. This youth was suddenly
attacked as he was returning home, carried
off, and never more heard of. The unfortunate
mother, distracted with grief, and
prompted by mingled hope and despair, wandered
up to the mountains, and for days was
seen by the shepherds roaming about and
calling for her son. It was thought that he
had been put to death in consequence of his
father having killed one of the brigands that
had attacked him.</p>

<p>I have not included the Circassians as
members of this general fraternity of brigands,
because they form a distinct set, who,
ever since their arrival in this country, have
been notorious for theft and crime and outrage.</p>

<p>Although political brigandage has ceased
to exercise its former influence in the country,
it has in a small degree again made its
appearance as an inseparable incident of war
and internal trouble. A few bands, mustering
from thirty to fifty men, have lately made
their appearance in different parts of European
Turkey. They are composed of Greek
desperadoes, supposed to be the agents of an
Ἑταιρεία, or secret society of violent Greek
patriots holding extreme views. Their object
in maintaining these <i>Klephts</i> in different
localities is that of having them in readiness
in case of an insurrection among the discontented
peasantry. One or two of these bands
have been stationed since last spring in the
district of Caterina. They have not been
known to molest any one; but their presence
somewhat kept in check the Albanian
brigands and prevented them devastating the
Greek villages. The Klephts obtained their
provisions from the peasants, for which they
regularly and scrupulously paid. The <i>Eteria</i>
that supports these individuals is disapproved
of by the Greek authorities, who consider it
an element of disorder and trouble.</p>

</div>

<p>The birth of a Turkish child is left very
much to nature, slightly aided by the unscientific
assistance of the <i>Ebé Kadin</i> or midwives,
who are very numerous in the country,
recruited from the lower strata of society,
and belonging to all creeds. They are
ignorant, uneducated, and possess not the
most rudimentary knowledge of medicine or
of the surgical art. Some of these women,
however, from long experience and natural
<i>savoir faire</i>, acquire a certain repute for ability,
well justified by the success they sometimes
obtain in difficult cases. All <i>Ebés</i> who
have attained this height of superiority are
much esteemed in Turkish society; they are
admitted into elevated circles, and are entitled
to special marks of honor and attention.</p>

<p>As soon as a Turkish child is born it is enveloped
in a tiny chemise and <i>Libardé</i>, or
quilted jacket of many colors, bound with a
swathe; its limbs are pulled straight down,
and then imprisoned in a number of quilted
wrappers and tightly bandaged all over by
another swathe, giving the unfortunate
mummified being the appearance of a Bologna
sausage. A red silk cap is placed on
the head, ornamented with a pearl tassel, one
or two fine gold coins, and a number of amulets
and charms against the evil eye.</p>

<p>These objects consist of a head of garlic, a
piece of alum, a copy of one or two verses of
the Koran plaited in little triangles and sewn
in bits of blue cloth, and a number of blue
glass ornaments in the shape of hands, horseshoes,
etc. The baby, thus decked out, is
next placed in a fine square quilted covering,
one corner of which forms a hood, the other
three being crossed over its body; a red
gauze veil, thrown over the whole, completing
its toilette. After the child’s birth a
state couch is prepared on a bedstead used
for the occasion, decorated with the richest
silks, the heaviest gold embroideries, and the
finest gauzes of the East. The bed is first
covered with a gauze sheet, worked with
gold threads; five or six long pillows of various
colored silks, covered with richly-embroidered
pillow-cases, open at the ends, occupy
the head and one side of the couch;
one or two <i>yorgans</i>, or quilted coverlets,
heavily laden with gold embroidery, occasionally
mixed with pearls and precious stones
and the under-sides lined with gauze sheets,
are thrown over it. On this bed of state the
happy mother is placed, at no small sacrifice
of ease and comfort. Her head is encircled
with a red <i>Fotoz</i>, or scarf, ornamented with a
bunch of charms similar to that placed on
the head of the child, the garlic insinuating
its head through the red veil that falls on the
temples. A stick, surmounted by an onion,
is placed in one corner of the room, against
the wall.</p>

<p>When these preliminary arrangements have
been made, the husband is admitted, who,
after felicitating his wife on the happy event,
has his offspring put into his arms; he at
once carries it behind the door, and after
muttering a short prayer, shouts three times
into the baby’s ear the name chosen for it.
He then gives back the infant to its mother,
and quits the room.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>For several days (the exact time depending
upon the mother’s health) water, either for
drinking or ablutionary purposes, is not
comprised in the régime imposed upon the
invalid, whose lips may be parched with
thirst, but not a drop of water is given to
her. Sherbet, made from a kind of candied
sugar and spices, varied by a tisane extracted
from the maidenhair fern, is the only
drink administered. Turkish ladies, after
confinement, get little rest; the moment the
event is known, relations, friends, and neighbors
crowd in, and are at once permitted to
enter the chamber and partake of sherbet,
sweets, and coffee, not even abstaining from
their inveterate habit of smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>On the second day a great quantity of this
sherbet is prepared, and bottles of it sent to
friends and acquaintances by <i>Musdadjis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
also an invitation to the <i>Djemiet</i>, or reception
held on the third day. The house on
this occasion is thrown open to visitors, invited
or uninvited. Dinner is served to the
former, and sherbet to the latter. Bands of
music are in attendance to receive and accompany
upstairs the most distinguished
guests, who arrive in groups, preceded by
servants bearing baskets of sweets prettily
got up with flowers and gilt paper and enveloped
in gauze tied up with ribbons.</p>

<p>The guests are first conducted into an ante-chamber,
where they are divested of their
<i>Yashmaks</i> and <i>Feridjés</i> (veils and cloaks) previously
to being introduced to the presence
of the invalid. The latter kisses the hands
of all the elderly <i>hanoums</i>, who say to her,
“Mashallah, ermuli kadunli olsoun.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Very
little notice is taken of the baby, and even
then only disparaging remarks are made
about it, both by relatives and guests, such
as <i>Murdar</i> (dirty), <i>Chirkin</i> (ugly), <i>Yaramaz</i>
(naughty). If looked at it is immediately
spat upon, and then left to slumber in innocent
unconsciousness of the undeserved abuse
it has received. Abusive and false epithets
are employed by Turkish women under all
circumstances worthy of inviting praise or
admiration, in order to counteract the supposition
of ill-feeling or malice underlying
the honeyed words of the speaker, which are
sure to be turned against her in case of any
accident or evil happening to the subject of
the conversation.</p>

<p>As soon as the visitors have departed a few
cloves are thrown into the brazier, to test
whether any ill effects of the evil eye have
been left behind. Should the cloves happen
to burst in burning, the inference is drawn
that the evil eye has exerted its influence;
the consequences of which can only be averted
by some hair from the heads of the
mother and child being cut off and burnt
with the view of fumigating the unfortunate
victims with the noxious vapor. Prayers
and sundry incantations, intermingled with
blowings and spittings, are made over the
heads of the stricken creatures, and only desisted
from when a fit of yawning proclaims
that the ill effects of the <i>Nazar</i> (evil eye) have
been finally banished.</p>

<p>The party suspected of having given the
Nazar is next surreptitiously visited by some
old woman, who manages to possess herself
of a scrap of some part of the suspected person’s
dress, with which a second fumigation
is made.</p>

<p>Among the lower orders, coffee, sugar, and
other provisions frequently replace the baskets
of sweets; and if the father of the child
is an official, his superior and subordinates
may accompany these with gifts of value.
The poor, who cannot afford to give dinners,
content themselves with offering sherbet and
coffee to their visitors. With the poor the
third, and with the rich the eighth, day is
appointed for the bathing of the mother and
child. There is a curious but deeply-rooted
superstition, accepted by all Turkish women,
which imposes upon them the necessity of
never leaving the mother and child alone, for
fear they should become <i>Albalghan mish</i>, possessed
by the Peris. The red scarves and
veils are, I believe, also used as preservatives
against this imaginary evil. When a poor
person is unavoidably left alone, a broom is
placed by the bedside to mount guard over
her and her child.</p>

<p>If the ceremony of the bath takes place in
the house, the <i>Ebé Kadin</i> and a number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
friends are invited to join the bathers and
partake of luncheon or some other refreshment.
When the ceremony is carried out at
the public bath, the company march there in
procession, headed by the <i>Ebé Kadin</i> carrying
the baby. Each family sends a carpet
and the bathing linen tied up in a bundle,
covered with embroidery and pearls sometimes
amounting in value to 30<i>l.</i> or 40<i>l.</i> The
mother and child are naturally the chief objects
of attention. The former, divested of
her clothing, is wrapped in her silk scarf
offered to her by the <i>Hammamji Hanoum</i>
(mistress of the bath), puts on a pair of high
pattens worked with silver, and is led into
the inner bath, supported on one side by the
Hammamji and on the other by some friend,
the baby in the charge of the <i>Ebé Kadin</i>
bringing up the rear. Hot water is thrown
over it, and it is rubbed and scrubbed, keeping
the company alive with its screams of
distress. This concluded, the infant is carried out,
and its mother taken in hand by her
<i>Ebé Kadin</i>, who, before commencing operations,
throws a bunch of keys into the basin,
muttering some prayers, and then blows
three times into it. A few pails of water are
thrown over the bather, and after the washing
of the head and sundry manipulations
have been performed she is led to the centre
platform, where she is placed in a reclining
position, with her head resting on a silver
bowl. A mixture of honey, spices, and aromatics,
forming a brownish mess, is thickly
besmeared all over her body, and allowed to
remain about an hour. Her friends surround
her during this tedious process, and amuse
her with songs and lively conversation, every
now and then transferring some of this composition
from her body to their mouths with
their fingers. The spicy coating thus fingered
gives to the lady a singular zebra like
appearance; but, though not becoming, it is
believed to possess very strengthening and
reviving powers, and it is considered a good
augury even to get only a taste of it. What
remains of this mixture after the friends have
been sufficiently regaled is washed off.</p>

<p>The lady, no doubt greatly benefited by
this application, is then wrapped in her bathing
dress, the borders of which are worked
with gold, and is ready to leave the bath.
Previous to doing so, she must make a round
of the baths, and kiss the hands of all the
elderly ladies, who say to her in return “<i>shifalou
olsoun</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Refreshments are offered in
abundance to the guests during the ceremony,
which lasts the greater part of the day.
These formalities are only <i>de rigueur</i> at the
birth of the first child; at other times they
are optional.</p>

<p>The cradle (<i>beshik</i>) plays a great part in the
first stage of baby existence. It is a very
strange arrangement, and, like many Turkish
things and customs, not very easy to
describe. It is a long, narrow, wooden box
fixed upon two rockers, the ends of which
rise a foot and a half above the sides, and
are connected at their summits by a strong
rail, which serves as a support to the nurse
when giving nourishment to the child. The
mattress is hard and no pillow is allowed.
The baby lies on its back with its arms
straight down by its sides, its legs drawn
down, and toes turned in.</p>

<p>It is kept in this position by a swathe,
which bandages the child all over to the cradle.
A small cushion is placed on the chest,
and another on the knees of the child, to keep
it in position and prevent the bandage from
hurting it. The infant thus secured becomes
a perfect fixture, the head being the only member
allowed the liberty of moving from side
to side. This strange contrivance (called the
<i>kundak</i>) has a very distorting effect, and is
one of the principal causes of the want of
symmetry in the lower limbs of the Turks and
of the Armenians (who are reared in the same
fashion), who are, as a rule, bow-legged and
turn their toes in. I believe the <i>kundak</i> system
is going out of fashion among the higher
classes, but it is still resorted to by the lower,
who find it extremely convenient on account
of the leisure it affords to the mother. The
child, thus disposed of, is left in the cradle
for five or six hours at a time; it is occasionally
nursed, and in the intervals sucks an
<i>emsik</i> composed of masticated bread and
sugar, or some Rahat lakoum (Turkish delight),
tied up in a piece of muslin.</p>

<p>All Turkish mothers and many Armenians
of the lower orders administer strong sleeping
draughts, generally of opium, poppy-head,
or theriac, to their infants; some carry the
abuse of these to such an extent that the
children appear always in a drowsy state,
the countenance pale, the eyelids half closed,
the pupils of the eyes contracted, the lips
parched and dry, and a peculiar hazy expression
fixed upon the face; all the movements
are lethargic, in marked contrast to
the sprightly motion of a healthy European
child. The natural baby-cry is replaced by a
low moan, and no eagerness is shown for the
mother’s milk, only an inclination to remain
listless and inactive. I have known mothers
give as many as five opium pills to a restless
child in one night. Besides the stupefying
effect of these opiates on the brain, they are
highly injurious to the digestive organs, occasioning
constipation, which, treated under
the designation of <i>sangyu</i> (colics), is increased
by frequent employment of heating medicines,
such as spirits of mint, camomile, or
aniseed. A Turkish mother never thinks of
giving her child an aperient; almond oil is
the nearest approach to a remedy of this kind.</p>

<p>Sleeplessness, uneasiness, or slight indisposition
in babies is generally put down to
the effects of the evil eye. Any old woman,
whose <i>nefs</i>, or breath, is considered most efficacious,
is called in. She takes hold of the
child, mutters prayers over it, exercising a
sort of mesmeric influence, and blowing it at
intervals, a remedy that results in soothing
the child to sleep for a while. Should her
breathing powers prove inefficacious, the
<i>Sheikh</i> (whose <i>nefs</i> is held in the highest esteem)
is called in. The magnetizing powers
of the latter are increased by the addition of
a <i>muska</i> (amulet) hung round the neck of the
child, for which a shilling is paid. When
all these remedies prove unavailing, the doctor
is applied to, but his advice, generally little
understood and less credited, is never
thoroughly carried out. The Turks have no
faith in medicine or doctors—“kismet” overrides
all such human efforts.</p>

<p>No régime is followed with regard to the
food of a child. It is allowed to eat whatever
it can get hold of, and digest it as best it
can. The excesses into which children are
liable to fall by the indulgence of sweets and
other unwholesome food often lead to serious
consequences. I have seen a splendid
child two years old die, after an illness of
seven hours, from indigestion caused by eating
an undue quantity of boiled Indian corn,
a favorite dish among Turkish children. I
have also witnessed two other similarly painful
cases; one of a girl nine years of age,
who, after consuming a large quantity of
heavy pastry, was found dead, crouched up
in a corner of a room; the other of a boy
seven years old, whose partiality for pickles
brought on inflammation of the bowels, from
which, after forty days, he died.</p>

<p>Turkish children are nursed up to the age
of eighteen months, and even to three years.
Some foolish mothers will nurse their children
as long as Nature supplies them with
the necessary nourishment. I knew a boy
of five years of age who was still being
nursed. The strangest part of this case was
that his foster-mother, a woman with whom
I was personally acquainted, had never had a
child of her own, but, determining to participate
in part in the sweets of maternity, had
adopted a baby, which she perseveringly
nursed till Nature by some strange freak
provided her with milk!</p>

<p>Weaning is perhaps the most critical period
of babyhood. A little basket is provided
by the tender parents, into which all kinds
of fruits and sweets are heaped, and left at
the child’s disposal to eat as much as it likes.
The consequence of this injurious custom is
the complete derangement and distension of
the stomach, the effects of which are often
noticeable in after-life. Rice and starch,
boiled in water, are the ingredients Turkish
women sometimes use for baby-food, feeding
them invariably with their fingers; but
it is impossible to say what they do or do not
feed them with, for there is no notion in
Turkey of a regular system for bringing up
children.</p>

<p>A rite of childhood which must not be
passed over, since it is accompanied by curious
ceremonies, is circumcision. The obligatory
duty of parents in this matter falls
heavily on the middle classes and entails
great expense upon the budget of the wealthy.
When a Turk of some standing is expected
to have a <i>Sunnet Duhun</i>, the coming event is
watched for by a number of persons who
cannot afford individually to undertake the
responsibility of the outlay the ceremony
would involve. All such individuals send in
the names of their children, begging that
they might be allowed to participate in the
ceremonial rite. The grandee appealed to
fixes the number of these according to his
means or his generosity. When the ceremony
takes place in the imperial palace, the
Sultans have not the liberty of limiting the
number of applicants, which sometimes
amounts to thousands, and occasions a very
heavy drain upon the treasury.</p>

<p>The <i>Sunnet Duhun</i> begins on a Monday
and lasts a whole week. The ages of the
candidates range from four to ten years.
The boys are sent to the bath, where the uncropped
tufts of hair left on the crown of
their heads are plaited with gold threads allowed
to hang down their backs up to the
moment of initiation. The chief candidate
is provided with a suit of clothes richly
worked with gold and ornamented on the
breast with jewels in the shape of a shield;
his fez is also entirely covered with jewels.
The number of precious ornaments necessary
for the ceremony is so great that they have
in part to be borrowed from relatives and
friends, who are in duty bound to lend them.
The caps and coats of all the minor aspirants
are equally studded with gems. They are
provided with complete suits of clothes by
the family in whose house the <i>Sunnet Duhun</i>
is held, by whom also all other expenses
connected with the ceremony are defrayed.</p>

<p>On the Monday, the youths decked out in
their parade costumes, and led by some old
ladies, make a round of calls at the harems
and invite their friends for the coming event;
Monday and Tuesday being dedicated to a
series of entertainments given in the Selamlik,
where hospitality is largely extended to the
poor as well as the rich. Wednesday and
Thursday are reserved to the Haremlik,
where great rejoicings take place, enlivened
by bands of music and dancing girls. On
the morning of the latter day the ladies busy
themselves in arranging the state bed, as
well as a number of others of more modest
appearance. The boys, in the mean time,
mounted upon richly-caparisoned steeds and
accompanied by their Hodjas, the family
barber, and some friends, and preceded by
music, pass in procession through the town.
On returning home the party is received at
the door by the parents of the boys. The
father of the principal candidate takes the
lead and stands by the side of the stepping-block,
the barber and Hodja taking their
places by his side. The horse of the young
bey is brought round, and the hand of the
father, extended to help him to dismount, is
stayed for a moment by that of the Hodja,
who solemnly asks him, “With what gift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
hast thou endowed thy son?” The parent
then declares the present intended for his
son, which may consist of landed property
or any object of value according to his means,
and then assists him to dismount. The other
boys follow, each claiming and receiving a
gift from his father or nearest of kin. Should
any of the boys be destitute of relatives, the
owner of the house takes the father’s place
and portions him.</p>

<p>The children are then taken to the Haremlik,
where they remain until evening, when
they return to the Selamlik and do not again
see their mothers till the morning of the completion
of the ceremony, when they are carried
to the Haremlik and placed upon the
beds prepared for them. The entertainments
this day are carried on in both departments.
The children are visited by all their friends
and relations, who offer them money and
other presents; the ladies every now and
then disappearing in order to allow the gentlemen
to enter and bring their offerings.
The money and gifts collected on these occasions
sometimes amount to considerable sums.
The Hodja and barber are equally favored.
The <i>Musdadji</i> receives a gold piece from the
mother on announcing to her the completion
of the sacred rite.</p>

<p>Every effort is made in the harem to amuse
and please the children, and beguile the time
for them till evening, when the fatigue and
feverish excitement of the day begin to tell
upon them, and they show signs of weariness,
the signal for the break-up of the party.
On the next day the boys are taken home by
their relatives, but the entertainments are
continued in the principal house till the following
Monday.</p>

<p>The Turks, hospitable on all occasions, are
particularly so on this, and consider it a religious
duty to show special regard and attention
to the poor and destitute.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give a definite idea of the
expense incurred by this ceremony among
the rich. The lowest estimate among the
middle classes, who limit it to one day,
would be from 10<i>l.</i> to 12<i>l.</i>, while the poor
are enriched by it to the extent of 2<i>l.</i> or 3<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Turkish children are subject to much the
same diseases as those of other nations. The
most terrible of these used to be small-pox,
which committed fearful ravages, carrying
off great numbers, and leaving its mark in
blindness or some other organic defect in
those who survived it. Its ravages, however,
have greatly diminished since the introduction
of vaccination, now pretty generally
adopted throughout the country.
Teething, measles, whooping-cough, scarlatina,
and low intermittent fevers are the
principal maladies prevalent among Turkish
children. A doctor is rarely called in; the
treatment of the invalid is left to the mother’s
instincts, aided by some old woman’s
doubtful pharmacopœia and the saintly influence
of <i>Hodjas</i>, whose superstitious rites are
firmly believed in by the applicants. Diphtheria,
unknown in the country until the arrival
of the Circassian immigrants, may also
be classed among the prevalent infantile maladies;
fortunately it has seldom been known
to rage as an epidemic, otherwise its ravages
would be incalculable by reason of the entire
disregard of quarantine laws.</p>

<p>Mortality, however, among Turkish children
is considerable, and one of the causes
why large families are so rarely to be met
with. A bey of Serres, for instance, possessed
of a goodly number of wives, who
had borne him about fifty children, saw only
seven of them live to attain manhood.</p>

<p>In wealthy families a wet-nurse is engaged,
called <i>Sut nana</i> (foster-mother), who enjoys
great privileges, both during the time she
serves and afterwards. Her own child becomes
the <i>Sut kardash</i> (foster-brother) of her
nursling, a bond of relationship recognized
through life, and allowing the foster-children,
if of different sexes, to set aside, if they
choose, the law of <i>Namekhram</i>, and see each
other freely. Besides the foster-mother, a
<i>Dadi</i>, or nursemaid, is at once appointed to attend
upon a child of rank. She has the care
of its wardrobe, and upon her devolves the
duty of sleeping near the cradle.</p>

<p>Correct statistical information of births
cannot be obtained, as no registration exists.
Census regulations were for the first time
introduced into the country by Sultan Mahmoud,
and they have been but imperfectly
carried out by his successors. During Sultan
Abdul-Medjid’s lifetime a census of the
population (excluding women) was made, but
the Mohammedans, fearing the consequences
in the conscription laws, tried as much as
possible to avoid giving correct information;
many people were represented as dead, others
put down far above or below their actual
ages. Every seven or eight years this census is
taken and each time more strictly enforced,
but the absence of birth-registration greatly
facilitates the frustration of the Government’s
desire for exact statements. The
number of children in a Turkish family, notwithstanding
the system of polygamy, is
never great, ranging between two and eight.
If the first children happen to be females, the
mother is still ambitious of possessing a male
child, but should the latter come first she is
satisfied, and resorts to every means in her
power to prevent further additions to her
family. A Turkish mother may practically,
with impunity, destroy her offspring if she
chooses at any stage of her pregnancy; and
this cruel and immoral custom is resorted to
by all classes of society, often resulting in
dangerous accidents, occasioning injuries
felt through life, and sometimes having fatal
results. Strong opiates are also resorted to
for the same purpose, as well as a number of
extraordinary means passing description.
Many dangerous medicines used with this
object, which in Europe are disposed of with
difficulty, or of which the sale is even prohibited,
are every year shipped for Turkey,
where they find numerous purchasers. During
a short visit I made to Philippopolis I
stayed at the house of the Mudir of Haskia;
his newly-married wife was very young, extremely
pretty, and delicate. She was very
much depressed at the idea of becoming a
mother, before becoming rather plumper;
for <i>embonpoint</i> is a great object of ambition
with Turkish ladies. When, on my return
to Haskia, I stopped at the same house, the
delicate beauty was dead, and her place already
filled by a robust young rustic, who
bustled about, trying with awkward efforts
to accustom her untrained nature to the
duties of her new position. On making
inquiries about the previous wife in whom I
was interested, I was quietly told that she
had succumbed about two months previously
to some violent measures she had used in
order to procure abortion, and had been
found dead in her bath. Her untimely end
was due to the instrumentality of a Jewish
quack, who, though having evidently caused
the death of the poor woman, never lost any
social position from what was simply considered
as a misadventure.</p>

<p>I have heard from a trustworthy Turkish
source that in Constantinople alone not less
that 4000 instances of abortion are procured
annually with the assistance of a class of women
known as Kaulii Ebé, who earn considerable
sums by their nefarious practice. This
statement has been confirmed by the “Djeridé
i Havadis” newspaper, and in an article
which appeared in the Bassuret newspaper
on the serious decrease of the population.
The writer (a Turk) says this decrease is owing,
first, to the conscription; secondly, to
polygamy; thirdly, to the prevalence of artificial
abortion; fourthly, to the absence of all
sanitary precautions in domestic economy.</p>

<p>The births among other Eastern nations
have all their peculiar ceremonies; some
originating in national traditions, others being
copied from the customs of the dominant
nation. Jewesses pride themselves greatly
when nature has made them prolific mothers;
even the poorest rejoice over successive
births, particularly when the children are
males. On all such occasions, friends and
relatives gather round the expectant mother,
giving much of their time to her company,
and making every effort to amuse her and
make her less sensitive to the pains and anxieties
of maternity. In some towns, Adrianople
for instance, regular <i>réunions</i> take place
round the sick-couch (including visitors of
both sexes), enlivened by music and dancing.
If the child be a girl, its name is given to it;
if a boy, it is circumcised. A Rabbi is called
in, and a godfather and godmother chosen.
The latter carries the baby to the door of the
room and delivers it to the former, who holds
the infant during the initiation; it is then
returned to the mother, and a feast is given
on the occasion.</p>

<p>The Armenians have conformed more to
the Turkish customs than any other race in
the country. An Armenian confinement is
assisted by a midwife, herself an Armenian,
and as ignorant as her Turkish colleague;
only in difficult cases is a doctor resorted to.
The ceremonies at an Armenian birth are
scarcely less superstitious than the Turkish
rites. They are of a more vague and indefinite
character. If possible, a mother and
child should not be left alone the first few
days; but the broom is replaced by the venerated
image of the Holy Virgin or some
saint, put on guard over the bed. Garlic is
not resorted to as a safeguard against the evil
eye, but holy water is nightly sprinkled over
child and mother, who are also fumigated
with the holy olive-branch. The company
received on these occasions is quiet, and only
part of the Turkish show and pageantry is
displayed in the adornment of the bed. The
child has the same Bologna sausage appearance,
modified by a European baby’s cap.
A neighbor of mine once brought her child
to me in great distress, saying it had not
ceased crying for three days and nights,
without her being able to guess the reason.
I made her at once unbandage the baby, and
soon discovered the cause. A long hair had
in some inexplicable manner wound itself
round the child’s thumb, which was swollen
to a disproportionate size through the stoppage
of the circulation, and was nearly severed
from the little hand.</p>

<p>About the ninth day the bath ceremony
takes place; but instead of the mother’s
body providing food for her guests by the
honeyed plaster of the Turkish woman, all sit
down to a substantial luncheon in which the
<i>Yahlan dolma</i> and the <i>lakana turshou</i> (Sauerkraut)
play a prominent part, and which is
brought into the bath on this occasion.</p>

<p>As the christening takes place within eight
days, it cannot on that account be witnessed
by the mother, who is unable to attend the
church services before the fortieth day, when
she goes to receive the benediction of purification.
Part of the water used for the christening
is presumably brought from the river
Jordan, and the child is also rubbed with holy
oil. The service concluded, the party walk
home in procession, headed by the midwife
carrying the baby. Refreshments are offered
to the company, who soon afterwards retire.
A gift of a gold cross or a fine gold coin is
made to the child by the sponsors.</p>

<p>No system of diet is followed in the rearing
of Armenian children, nor are their bodies
refreshed by a daily bath. Few people in
the East bathe their children, like Europeans,
for a general idea prevails that it is an injurious
custom and a fertile cause of sickness.
Kept neither clean nor neat, they are allowed
to struggle through infancy in a very irregular
manner. Yet in spite of this they are
strong and healthy.</p>

<p>The customs among the higher classes of
Greeks and Bulgarians are very much alike.
The latter, though now more backward, were
till lately pretty faithful copies of the former.
Their usages differ according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
district, and depend upon the degree of progress
civilization has made among the people.
At Constantinople, for instance, everything
takes place just as in Europe; but in
district towns, such as Adrianople, Salonika,
Vodena, Serres, many of the superstitions of
the ancient Greeks may still be found in connection
with the birth of a child. At Serres,
for example, the event is awaited in silence
by the midwife and a few elderly relatives;
when the little stranger arrives, the good
news is taken to the anxious father, and then
circulated through the family, who soon collect
round the maternal couch and offer their
hearty felicitations, saying, “Νἀ πολυχρονήση.”
The infant in its turn receives the same
good wishes, and after being bathed in salt
and water is wrapped up (but not mummified)
and laid by the side of the mother, who can
press its little hand and watch its tiny feet
moving about under their coverings. The
couch is kept for three days, when the accouchée
is made to rise from it, walking in a
stream of water poured by the <i>mammê</i> (accoucheuse)
from a bottle along her path.
This custom must be connected with the
conception of water as the emblem of purity,
and must be intended to remind the mother
that her strength must ever rest upon her
chastity. On this night a woof and some
gold and silver coins are placed under the
pillow, as a hint to the Moeræ, or fates, who
are supposed to visit the slumbering infant,
that they may include riches and industry in
the benefits they bestow upon it.</p>

<p>The christening, as a rule, takes place
within eight days after the birth. The
<i>Koumbáros</i> and the <i>Koumbára</i> (also called
<i>Nono</i> and <i>Nona</i>) stand as godfather and godmother
to the child, who is carried to the
church by the <i>mammê</i> followed by the sponsors,
the relatives, and friends invited to the
ceremony. The cost of the baptismal robe,
the bonbons, liqueurs, and all other expenses
connected with the rite are defrayed by the
Nono. The lowest estimate of the cost is 2<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i>, and, though a great outlay for a poor
family, they are never known to be omitted.</p>

<p>The child, held by the godfather, is met
at the church door by the officiating priests,
who read over it part of the service, the
Nono responding to the questions.</p>

<p>The priest then holds the child in an erect
attitude, and standing on the steps of the
church makes the sign of the cross with it.
It is then taken by the godfather and placed
for a moment before the shrine of Christ or
the Virgin, according to its sex, while the
priests, proceeding to the font, pour in the
hot water and some of the oil brought by the
sponsor and consecrated in the church. The
infant is taken from his hands, and in its original
nakedness plunged three times into the
font. Three pieces of hair are cut from its
head in the form of crosses and thrown into
the water, which is poured into a consecrated
well in the church. The cutting off of these
locks of hair probably had its origin in a
custom observed by the ancient Greeks, who
dedicated their hair to the water deities; now
it signifies the dedication of the infants to
Christ at their baptism.</p>

<p>The sign of the cross is made on the head
and parts of the body with holy oil, signifying
confirmation. The child is then delivered
into the hands of the godmother, who carries
it three times round the font while prayers
are being read; it is then taken to the
holy gates, where the communion is administered
in both hands with a spoon, so that the
three sacraments, baptism, confirmation, and
the Eucharist, are all given to the child while
an unconscious infant.</p>

<p>The service concluded, the party return to
the house to partake of bonbons, liqueurs,
etc., and to be decorated with small crosses
attached to favors given as mementoes of the
event.</p>

<p>The members of the orthodox church are
perhaps the only people who do not content
themselves with making solemn promises for
the child, but conscientiously fulfil them to
the best of their ability. The Nono and
Nona, in consequence of the responsibilities
they assume, become so closely connected
with their godchildren that marriage between
these and their own children is not
permitted.</p>

<p>While the Bulgarian lady in town is setting
aside many of the usages and superstitions
attached to the rearing of children, a
word or two about her hardy sister in the rural
districts may not be out of place here.
While staying at Bulgarian villages it was
very pleasant to me to watch the simplicity,
activity, and wonderful physical strength of
the peasantry.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian women are rather small but
thickly set, their chests well developed, their
limbs powerful through constant exercise,
and their whole frames admirably adapted
for bearing children. They do not, as a
rule, bear many, as they seldom marry young,
and their life of constant toil and hardship
makes them sterile before the natural time.</p>

<p>The delicate touch of refinement has not
yet reached these strong natures, whose systems,
kept free from special care and anxiety,
remain proof against shocks that would kill
many an apparently strong woman whose
physical training had not been the same.
Providence is the sole guardian that watches
over these peasants, and nature the only
fountain from which they derive their support.
I remember the ease of a Bulgarian
<i>bulka</i>, the wife of a tenant attached to the
farm at which I was staying. She was a fine
young woman, bright-looking, clean, and
well dressed; her bare feet were small and
well shaped, her mien erect and free, although
she appeared far advanced in pregnancy.
Daily I used to watch her walk out
of the yard, with her two large copper pails
slung on a rod gracefully poised on her
shoulder, and go to the fountain to fetch
water. One evening I saw her return later
than usual; her step seemed lighter although
her pails were full, and her pretty apron, the
ends of which were tucked into her sash,
contained something I could not well discern
at a distance, but which, as she approached,
I was surprised to see was a new-born baby,
with its tiny feet peeping out on one side.
Passing the door of a neighbor, she smilingly
beckoned to her, pointing to the infant in
her apron, and asked for her assistance. I
followed shortly after, curious to see how
fared this prodigy of nature. I found her
quietly reposing on the bed that had been
hastily prepared for her on the floor, while
her companion was washing the infant. The
latter, after its bath, was thoroughly salted,
wrapped in its clothes, and laid by the side
of the mother; but the miseries of the little
being did not end there; a pan was produced,
some oil poured into it and set to
boil; in this three eggs were broken and
cooked into an omelette. This was placed on
a cloth with a quantity of black pepper sifted
over it, and applied to the head of the unfortunate
infant, who began at once to
scream in great distress. I naturally inquired
the benefit to be derived in salting and
poulticing the new-born child, and was told
that if not salted, its feet or some other part
of its body would exhale offensive odors, and
that the application of the poultice was to
solidify the skull and render it proof against
sunstroke. The next morning the mother
was up going through the usual routine of
her household work. She assured me that
in a few days she would resume her field labor,
carrying her suckling with her, which,
she added, “now fanned by the evening
breeze, now scorched by the burning rays of
the sun, would all the same brave the adverse
elements: <i>Ako ema strabi jive</i> (if it has life
to live).”</p>

<p>Struck by the fatalistic meaning of her
words, I asked how could a weak or delicate
child stand such a trial. “Stand it!” she
repeated, “who said it did? With us a delicate
child does not outlive the year.” The
Archangel would silently come upon it one
day as it slumbered under the shade of some
spreading tree and snatch away its innocent
soul while the mother was toiling in the field
to gain her daily bread and put by something
for those left behind. “Happy they!”
she went on, while hot tears ran down her
cheeks. “Let the little souls depart in
peace, and await in heaven the souls of their
unfortunate mothers whom God and man
seem to have abandoned to cruel adversity,
heart-rending sorrows, distress, and despair.”
I was deeply affected by this genuine outburst
of grief, and did all in my power to
console her.</p>

<p><i>Du sublime au ridicule il n’y a qu’un pas!</i>
Next morning, on a tour I made round the
village, I stepped into a cottage that teemed
with little children, and here I unexpectedly
met with my second heroine, who, although
a Spartan in body, was not specially vigorous
as to mind. My other Bulgarian <i>bulka</i> was
a fat, jolly little woman verging towards
middle age, the mother of ten children, most
of whom had come by twins in rapid succession.
The two youngest, born the day before,
were just now reposing in kneading-troughs,
violently rocked by their elder sisters,
while the mother, surrounded by this
happy family, was occupied in kneading
bread.</p>

<p>As she saw me come in she advanced and
welcomed me with the usual salutation. I
questioned her about her children, and how
she managed to bring up and feed such a
number, often having the care of two infants
at a time. “Oh,” said she, “it is no trouble.
I and my cow, being two, manage between
us to set the little mites on their legs.
Yesterday, two hours after the arrival of my
two children,” pointing to the troughs, “my
cow poked her head in at the door lowing
for me and for her calf. What could I do?
I got up and milked her as usual, and sent
her to her young one, while I fed my numerous
family with her milk. We peasants who
till the ground have not much time to think
about ourselves or to give to our children,
who cannot begin too early to accustom
themselves to the hardships that await them
through life. When the troubles of maternity
are greater than usual, the oldest shepherd
of the village is called in and performs
for us the services of a doctor, and when any
one among us is ailing, frictions and aromatic
potions will cure him.”</p>

</div>

<p>A Turkish kitchen is a spacious building,
roughly constructed, and, in the dwellings of
the rich, generally detached from the rest of
the house. A deep arched opening made in
the wall facing the door forms the foundation
of the cooking-range, which is raised about
three feet from the ground and consists of a
row of <i>Ogaks</i>—holes with grates in them
over a sort of ash-bed, where the <i>Kebab</i>, or
roast, is cooked and the smaller dishes kept
warm. A sink of a primitive description occupies
one side of the kitchen, and a plate-rack,
containing the cooking utensils, another.
The side facing the house is of open
lattice-work; the floor is invariably of stone.
Great attention is paid to keeping the culinary
utensils, which are all of copper, clean
and bright; but order and neatness in other
respects are entirely disregarded, and there
are few of those arrangements that render
an English kitchen such a pleasant and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
apartment. A tin lamp, such as
has been used from time immemorial, is
hung at one side of the chimney, and gives
but a very dim light.</p>

<p>The kitchen is generally included in the
department of the Haremlik, and is presided
over by one or two negresses, who make very
good cooks. The fresh provisions are purchased
daily by the <i>Ayvas</i>, or purveyor, generally
an Armenian, and passed in through
the <i>Dulap</i>, a revolving cupboard in the wall
between the Haremlik and Selamlik, used
for most communications between the two
departments; a loud knock on either side
being answered by a servant who comes to
hear what is wanted.</p>

<p>The Turks have two meals a day; one,
<i>kahvalto</i>, between ten and eleven, and the
other, <i>yemek</i>, at sunset. One or two cups of
black coffee is all they lake in the early
morning. The dinner is brought into the
dining-room of the Haremlik on a large circular
copper tray, and deposited on the floor;
a similar tray is placed on a stool and covered
with a common calico cloth. On this are
placed a number of saucers containing <i>hors
d’œuvres</i>, a salt-cellar, a pepper-box, and a
portion of bread for each person. A leather
pad occupies the centre, on which the dishes
are placed in succession, and the company sit
cross-legged round the tray. Dinner is announced
by a slave—the hostess leads the
way into the <i>Yemek oda</i>, or dining-room.
Servants approach and pour water over the
hands from <i>Ibriks</i>, or curious ewers, holding
<i>Leyens</i>, or basins, to catch it as it falls;
others offer towels as napkins to use during
the meal. As many as eight or ten persons
can sit round these trays. The hostess, if
she be of higher rank than her guests, is the
first to dip her spoon into the soup-tureen,
politely inviting them to do the same; if
her rank be inferior to that of any one of her
guests, they are invited to take precedence.</p>

<p>Turkish soups resemble very thick broth,
and are altogether unlike those found on European
tables. After the soup has been sparingly
partaken of, it is removed on a sign
from the hostess and replaced by the other
dishes in succession. The sweets are eaten
between the courses. The left hand is used
to convey the food to the mouth, the thumb
and two first fingers doing the duty of forks.</p>

<p>It is considered a mark of great attention
on the part of the hostess to pick up the
daintiest bit of food, and place it in the
mouth of any of her guests. <i>Pilaf</i>, the national
dish, composed principally of rice, and
<i>Hochaf</i> (stewed fruits, iced), are the last
dishes placed on the table. Pure water is
the only drink allowed in the <i>Haremlik</i>, and
is handed, when required, in tumblers held
by slaves standing behind the company.
Before leaving the <i>Yemek oda</i>, the <i>Ibriks</i> and
<i>Leyens</i> are again resorted to. On re-entering
the drawing-room, coffee and cigarettes are
immediately handed round. The way in
which coffee is served is one of the prettiest
of the old Turkish customs. All the slaves
and attendants enter the rooms and stand at
the lower end with folded arms. The coffee-pot
and cup-stands of gold or silver are placed
on a tray held by the <i>Kalfa</i>, or head-servant;
attached to the tray is an oval crimson
cloth, richly worked with gold. The
coffee is poured out, and the cups offered
separately by the other servants, who again
retire to the lower end of the room till they
are required to take the empty cups.</p>

<p>On my last visit to the capital I found
many changes, and noticed that many European
customs had been adopted in some of
the principal houses, tables and chairs having
replaced the dinner-trays in most of
them, and even a complete European dinner-service
might in some houses be found in
use. I happened to visit a Pasha’s harem,
and was invited to stay to luncheon; on being
ushered into the dining room, I was
agreeably surprised to find myself in a spacious
apartment, furnished in the European
style, and surrounded on three sides by a
lovely garden where the rose, the jasmine,
and the orange blossomed in profusion,
breathing their delicious perfume into the
room through the open windows. Three tables,
richly laid, stood in the room; a large
one, occupying the centre, and two smaller
ones in corners. The centre one was reserved
for the <i>Hanoum</i> and such of her guests as
were entitled by their rank to be admitted to
her table, the second for her daughter and
her young companions, and the third for
guests of an inferior degree. The luncheon
went off very well, although one or two of
the company appeared little accustomed to
the use of knives and forks, which they held,
indeed, in their hands, but, forgetful of the
fact, conveyed the food to their mouths with
their fingers, and consequently made a few
scratches on their noses. This <i>maladresse</i>
occasioning some merriment to the others,
these offenders against European customs
laid down the dangerous implements and
took to their own method of eating, a very
good one of its kind and demanding much
more skill than the European manner. There
is a neatness in the Turkish way of manipulating
the food that can only be acquired by
care and long practice; the thumb and two
fingers alone must touch the meat, the rest
of the hand remaining perfectly clean and
free from contact with it.</p>

<p>Another incident of an amusing nature
would have tended to increase our merriment
had not Turkish equanimity imposed upon
us the necessity of ignoring it. Mustard, an
unusual condiment on a Turkish table, was
handed round, perhaps in honor of my presence.
An old lady, not knowing what it
was, took a spoonful, and before any one had
time to interfere, had swallowed it. Her
face became crimson, tears ran down her
cheeks, she sneezed and appeared choking;
but at last, with a supreme effort, she regained
her composure, and looked as pleasant
as circumstances would allow.</p>

<p>The use of knives and forks, though fast
becoming general among the higher classes at
Stamboul, is not yet much introduced into
the interior. During my residence in one of
the provincial towns of European Turkey,
these articles were occasionally borrowed
from me by a rich bey for his grand entertainments.
The forks I lent were electro-plate;
but when they were returned I found
silver ones among them, and discovered that,
some of mine having been stolen or lost, the
bey had them copied by native workmen.</p>

<p>The most refined Turkish cookery is not
costly; the materials consist of mutton, fowl,
fish, flour, rice, milk, honey, sugar, vegetables,
and fruit. All the dishes are cooked in
clarified butter in a simple manner, and fat
or oil is seldom used. The average number
of dishes sent to table in a wealthy house is
nine at each meal. The meat is always over-cooked
and badly served, except the lamb
roasted whole, stuffed with rice and pistachios,
and the <i>Kebab</i>. The latter consists of
small pieces of meat cooked on skewers, and
served on a <i>Peta</i>, a species of batter pudding.
Another favorite dish is the <i>Imam Baildi</i>, or
“The Imam fainted;” it is composed of aubergines
and onions cooked in oil, and has
the following rather vapid little history attached
to it. An Imam stole some oil from
the mosque in his care, the whole of which
his ingenious wife used in cooking a dish she
had just invented. This was being partaken of
with much relish by the Imam till he was
informed that all the oil had been consumed
in its preparation, when he immediately
fainted. Some of these dishes are excellent,
and are relished even by Europeans.</p>

<p>Two <i>Sofras</i>, or tables, are furnished by the
cook at each meal; one for the <i>Haremlik</i> and
the other for the <i>Selamlik</i>. After the master
and mistress have left the tables the servants
take the vacant seats. The supply is unlimited,
and much waste and extravagance ensue,
owing to the number of guests of high
and low degree that are always expected to
drop in to dinner.</p>

<p>During Abdul-Medjid’s reign I visited the
imperial kitchen, an immense establishment,
giving employment to 500 cooks and scullions.
Among some curious details I learnt
respecting this department, one referring to
the functions of the head-cook may not be
uninteresting. This unfortunate individual
was chained to the stove by being obliged to
provide an hourly meal for the Sultan, whose
repasts depended upon his caprice, and who
required that food should be ready for him
at any moment.</p>

<p>Abdul-Aziz was an enormous eater, and a
great gourmet; he was often known to empty
a dish of six eggs cooked in butter, with
<i>Pastourmah</i>, a kind of dried meat, in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>It was one of his peculiarities to throw his
food at the heads of his ministers when displeased
with them, and this favorite dish
often experienced that fate. During the latter
part of his reign his meals were prepared
in the harem, under the superintendence of
the Validé Sultana, who enveloped every
dish in crape, and tied and sealed it with her
own seal before sending it into the Selamlik.</p>

<p>Another illustrious man, A⸺ K⸺
Pasha, surpassed his august sovereign in
gluttony; while in Albania, I was assured
by more than one eye-witness that he frequently
consumed the whole of a stuffed
lamb at a meal.</p>

<p>Bread forms the fundamental part of a
poor man’s food; with it he eats <i>kattuk</i>,
which comprises cheese, treacle, halva, fruit,
onions, garlic, etc., etc. Fruit is extremely
cheap and good, and is largely consumed by
all classes. Poor families can subsist upon
from a shilling to one and sixpence a day.</p>

<p>In the Turkish quarter, where the rich live
side by side with the poor, the latter have
often the opportunity of eating a good dinner;
they have only to drop in at the rich
man’s door, and hospitality is at once extended
to them. This kind of charity, however,
is greatly on the decrease, owing, no
doubt, to the financial embarrassment generally
felt throughout the country.</p>

<p>The kitchen department, both in Greek
and Bulgarian families, is superintended by
the mistress of the house, who orders dinner,
and daily or weekly regulates the expenses.</p>

<p>The food of the middle classes of the Christians
differs only from that of the Turks in
the addition of the Lent dishes. During this
period the poorer orders consume more garlic,
onions, olives, and dried fish.</p>

<p>The Greeks appear to have been the first
of the natives of this country to adopt the
custom of eating with knives and forks and
making their meals at a table. Except in
wealthy houses in the capital, their table arrangements
are very deficient and inelegant;
till very recently the napkins and table-cloths
were either home-woven or made of unbleached
calico. The knives and forks were
of steel and iron, clumsy productions from
Austria and Bohemia, and the glass and
crockery from the same countries were of
uncouth forms, sold at high prices. The
competition in the sale of these articles that
France and England have of late years established
in the country has not only created a
marked improvement in the quality of these
necessaries, but has also reduced their prices
and brought them within the reach of all.
Most families are possessed of a certain
amount of table silver, in the shape of forks,
spoons, etc.; these are, however, being replaced
by electro-plate, now abundantly introduced.</p>

<p>The Jews and Armenians have many
strange and interesting customs in the matter
of eating. The Armenians are renowned for
their gluttony and extreme fondness for good
things. Until lately they took their meals in
a manner very similar to the Turks. They
would use their knives and forks to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
extent, but their fingers much more. The
lower orders still sit on the floor round a table
about eight inches high. Their dishes,
with the addition of a few national ones, resemble
those of the Turks, and they are famous
for the manufacture of very rich sweets
of various kinds. The kitchen, being the
most important department in an Armenian
house, demands the daily supervision of
both master and mistress; the former has the
supreme voice in selecting the dishes, and the
latter often takes an active part in their preparation.
I knew a wealthy Armenian who
married the daughter of his cook in order to
secure the permanent services of the mother.
He assured me of the perfect bliss the alliance
had brought him in the possession of a
pretty wife and the daily enjoyment of the
<i>dolmas</i> made by his mother-in-law. Some
time ago a well-known and wealthy Englishman
fell in love with and married a worthless
Armenian girl, having seen her, from a
neighboring house, preparing the same dish.
He had, however, reason to repent thus making
his appetite his only consideration; life
became no longer endurable with such an unsympathetic
helpmate, and he absconded and
returned to his native land, it is to be hoped
a wiser man.</p>

<p>The Jews in the East observe, with the
greatest strictness, all the outward forms of
their religion, and particularly those relating
to food, whose preparation is regulated by a
great many strange and complicated laws.</p>

<p>All flesh is <i>Tourfa</i>, or unclean, unless the
animal has been killed in the presence of a
Rabbi, who hands to the butcher a special
knife (after having examined the animal in
order to ascertain if it be clean or unclean)
with which he must sever the windpipe at a
single stroke; should he fail to do so the animal
is considered unclean and cannot be
eaten. Even in case of success, parts of the
flesh only are acceptable to them, and all the
fat adhering to the muscles must be removed
before it is cooked. Cheese, wine, and sundry
other provisions are not considered
clean unless made by Israelites; butter is seldom
bought, and only when sold in skins
with the hairy side turned inwards. Six
hours must elapse before a Hebrew can touch
cheese, milk, or butter after having partaken
of meat, though he is at liberty to eat meat
directly after these. The dishes are cooked
in sesame oil, an ingredient that renders
them quite distasteful to any but Jewish palates;
this oil is also used for making pastry,
which is very heavy and indigestible. In
fact, their cookery is so peculiar and unpalatable
that when a Jew entertains Gentiles he
generally resorts to foreign dishes. When
a Turk or Christian wishes to extend his
hospitality to an Israelite, he is obliged to
have most of the food prepared by a cook of
the Hebrew faith.</p>

<p>A duty on all that is <i>Tourfa</i> is imposed by
the Rabbi of each community; this tax,
amounting to a considerable sum, is set apart
for charitable purposes, and for the support
of schools for the poor. It is, on the whole,
a strange kind of charity, for after all it is
only taking the money out of the pockets of
the poor in one form to give it back to them
in another, and the tax falls heavily on the
Jewish communities, since they are principally
composed of poor people. Several attempts
have been made by them, especially
in Salonika, to have it removed, but hitherto
their efforts have been fruitless.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Jews is, with a few
exceptions, limited to members of their own
race, and even then not very largely practised.
The customs of the Israelites who
have received a European education differ
very little from those of the Franks.</p>

<p>During the numerous journeys I have had
occasion to make in Turkey I have always
found genuine and hearty hospitality offered
to me both by Turks and Christians. I
generally accepted that of the latter, as it
is more in unison with our own customs
and habits. Every effort was made on the
part of my entertainers to please me and anticipate
my wants, and I have often been
both delighted and surprised to find in the
heart of barbarous little towns such comforts
as a bedstead, basin, and table service, besides
other articles, the use of which did not
always appear quite clear to their possessors.
In one Bulgarian house, for instance, I was
offered wine in a feeding-bottle, which was
handed in turn to the rest of the company.
This ludicrous utensil would probably have
been refused if fate had not ordained me to
be the first baby to drink from it.</p>

<p>As a contrast to this incident I must not
forget to mention one of a far superior order.
Passing through Sofia, I put up at the house
of a wealthy Bulgarian Chorbadji; it was a
large building, pretty comfortably furnished,
and very neat and clean in appearance.
Scarcely had I rested the needful time after
my journey and partaken of <i>Slatko</i>, or preserved
fruit, and coffee, when my hostess
came to ask if I were not desirous of taking
a bath of milk and rose-water. This proposal,
denoting such a high standard of luxury,
took me by surprise, and my desire to know
its origin exceeded the wish of taking immediate
advantage of it. The question had to
be solved, and I thought the best way of explaining
it would be to ask my hostess if this
was an indispensable part of the toilet of the
<i>élite</i>. It was now her turn to look surprised.
“Oh, dear no, <i>Gospoyer</i>,” she exclaimed, “I
made the offer believing it to be one of your
own customs, as two English maidens who
lodged in my house some time ago daily
made use of what they called ‘a most refreshing
and indispensable luxury.’ Oh, dear no,
Gospoyer,” she repeated, “we are too thrifty
a people to think of wasting a quantity of
good milk that could be converted into so
much cheese and butter; but you Franks are
an extravagant race.” There was a good
deal of truth in what she said, so, making a
compromise in these good things, I willingly
accepted the offer of the rose-water, which is
plentiful in the town, as Sofia is not far from
the principal rose-growing districts.</p>

<p><i>Autre pays, autres mœurs.</i> During a flying
visit I paid to Kara Hissar, in Asia Minor, I
took up my quarters at the house of an
opium-growing grandee. The dinner offered
to me was good, and even refined, but for a
slight but peculiar flavor to which I was unaccustomed;
I partook of it heartily, and
afterwards, in order to please my hostess,
accepted a cigarette. Presently I felt a
strange languor creeping over me, my head
whirled, my ears began to tingle, my eyesight
dimmed, and, my eyelids heavily closing,
I soon found myself in the fool’s paradise of
opium-eaters. All sorts of sweet
dreams took possession of my imagination,
crossed by the most ludicrous thoughts and
desires. I imagined that trains were running
down my arms; next my travelling-boots,
which I had exchanged for slippers, attracted
my attention, and although not very large,
they took to my deluded vision the proportions
of a grotto, towards which I made a
desperate rush, and soon felt exhausted with
the efforts I made to enter it. My hostess
took the form of a rat, from whose presence
I vainly tried to escape; I went towards the
open window, where the pure night-air
somewhat refreshed me, and the twinkle of
the myriad bright stars raised my mind to
higher thoughts, and sensations of an indescribably
delicious character took possession
of me. I became poetical, and surprised my
entertainers by my declamations which, needless
to say, were quite unintelligible to them.
I finally retired to rest, and sleep overtaking
me consigned all to oblivion. On awaking
next morning, I felt very uncomfortable; in
fact, I was ill. The meal of which I had
partaken had been cooked in poppy-oil,
always used for the purpose in that part of
the country, and said not to have any effect
on the inhabitants, who are accustomed to it
from childhood. The cigarette, it appeared,
was also strongly impregnated with the same
narcotic. Let my experience be a warning
to travellers in the opium-growing country.</p>

<p>It is the custom throughout Turkey to
offer as refreshment the <i>Tatlou</i>, a rich kind
of preserve made from fruits, or flowers such
as roses, lilies, violets, and orange-blossoms.
It is brought in soon after the entrance of a
visitor. The service used for the purpose
may be of the most costly or of the simplest
description; that used in Turkish harems is
always of some precious metal, and comprises
a salver, two preserve basins, a double spoon-basket,
and a number of goblets and spoons.
The edge of the salver, like that used for the
coffee, is surrounded by a gold-embroidered
cloth; the slave who offers it does so on
bended knee.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i>Tatlou</i>, in Turkish
Konaks, sherbet, immediately followed by
coffee, is offered to visitors when about to
leave or when the hostess is desirous of being
relieved of their company. This beverage is
made from the juices of fruits, cooled with
ice; it is brought in on a tray in goblets. A
number of slaves holding richly embroidered
napkins (on one end of which the goblet is
placed, resting on the palm of the hand), offer
the cup to the guests, who wipe their lips on
the other end. A fermented drink, called
<i>Boza</i>, made from millet seed, is very largely
consumed by the lower orders; it is of two
kinds, <i>tatlou</i> and <i>ekshi</i>, sweet and sour. The
latter, possessing intoxicating properties, is
thick and muddy, and has a peculiar earthy
taste.</p>

<p>Wine, both good and abundant, is consumed
in moderation by Jews, Christians,
and Europeans, and of late years “La Jeune
Turquie” has manifested a decided partiality
for it. Turks generally dine in the Selamlik,
where those who are addicted to drink (a custom
prevalent among the higher orders) begin
some hours before the evening meal to partake
freely of <i>mezzeliks</i>, which they wash
down with copious draughts of <i>raki</i>. It is
not rare to find Turks who have never tasted
wine or spirits in their lives; but one seldom
hears of a Turk once addicted to their
use who does not nightly make a gross abuse
of them, a habit which tends greatly to increase
the vices of Turkish society. It is repugnant
to point out the many evils that result
from such orgies, and would be still
more so to illustrate them with the many incidents
that have come under my notice.</p>

<p>A true follower of the Prophet will refrain
from wine, as prohibited by the Koran. The
popular belief about the cause of the prohibition
is that Mohammed when on his way
to the mosque one day saw a band of his followers,
whose happy looks and gay laughter
made a pleasant impression upon him. He
inquired the cause, and was told that they
were lively through having partaken of wine;
he approvingly smiled and passed on. On
his return the scene of merriment was
changed to one of strife and bloodshed, and
he was informed that it was the result of
drunkenness. He then laid a curse upon the
liquor that had occasioned the disaster, and
upon all who should thenceforth indulge in
it.</p>

<p>Coffee in Turkey is prepared in a manner
far superior to that of any other country. I
will give the recipe for its preparation for
the benefit of any who may like to try it.
Water is placed in a peculiarly-shaped coffee-pot
with a long handle and a beak-shaped
spout. This is pushed sideways against a
charcoal fire, and when the water has arrived
at the boiling point it is withdrawn, a small
quantity of its contents poured into a cup and
a few spoonfuls of finely-pulverized coffee
(according to the number of cups required) is
mixed in the coffee-pot, which is again placed
against the fire and the contents gently shaken
up once or twice while a thick scum rises on
the surface. Before it has time to boil up
again it is again withdrawn and the water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
that had been poured out is put back. It is
then replaced on the fire, and when finally
withdrawn is gently knocked once or twice,
and after standing a few moments is poured
out and served.</p>

<p>Sugar, not taken by the Turks, may be
added before or after boiling. There is some
little art required in the making, but the
quality of the coffee and the manner in which
it is roasted are the most important points.
The roasting must be done to a turn, leaving
the coffee, when ground, a rich golden
brown.</p>

<p>Milk, very plentiful in the country, is made
into very indifferent cheese, excellent clotted
cream, called <i>Kaymak</i>, and sour cream,
called <i>Yaourt</i>. The latter, being very cheap
and good, forms a great part of the nourishment
of the people; it is prepared and sold
in large dairy-pans, which the vendors carry
on their heads. One of these pans served
some years ago in a practical joke that the
gay <i>jeunesse</i> of our Embassy played in the
Prince’s Islands on an Armenian tutor, who
mentor-like followed three young ladies in
their walks, evidently to the dislike of the
lively ladies and the scheming young diplomatists,
who had made up their minds to steal
a kiss from the cheeks of the young beauties
should occasion offer. During a meeting of
the parties, a <i>Yaourtji</i> passing by at the moment
seemed admirably suited for their purpose;
one of the gentlemen, famous for his
freaks, seized the basin, and poured its contents
over the head of the unfortunate tutor,
who, blinded by the cream running down
his face, was unable to notice what passed.</p>

<p><i>Ashji Dukyan</i>, or cook-shops, are numerous
in all the bazars of Eastern towns. Those at
Stamboul have a great reputation, especially
the <i>Kebabjis</i>, where <i>Kebab</i> and fruit only are
sold. The food is served on copper dishes,
and the customers sit on stools round little
tables in neat gardens attached to the establishments.</p>

<p>The <i>Ashji dukyan</i> contain on one side a
long range for cooking, upon which are
placed bright copper pans, whence issues the
steam from a number of savory dishes. The
other side is occupied by a platform, upon
which the customers sit cross-legged round
low <i>Sofras</i>, to partake of the dishes of their
choice plentifully placed before them, accompanied
by bread and water <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>On visiting the East the first thing that attracts
the attention of the traveller is the
variety of costume he meets at every step,
especially among the Mohammedan population.</p>

<p>The dress of the first Ottomans was simple.
Othman, the founder of the Empire, is
represented as seated on a square throne, similar
to that of the Shahs of Persia, ornamented
with inlaid mother of pearl. He
wore on his head a red cloth cap half buried
in a Tatar turban, and called <i>Burki
Khorasani</i>; wide trousers, and a bright-colored
jacket descending to his knees. A
splendid yataghan was fastened in his belt,
and a flowing <i>kaftan</i>, surmounted by a red
collar, enveloped the whole. The boots or
shoes were of bright scarlet or yellow.</p>

<p>Sultan Orkhan and his Grand Vizir devoted
much time to the regulation of the forms and
colors of garments and head-dresses. These
measures subsequently embraced all the details
of the fashion, material, linings, and
borders of the kaftans, dolmans, and pelisses
of honor worn by the different functionaries
at state ceremonies. Costume became the
distinguishing mark of rank among the ruling
race, and the token of creed among the subject
nations.</p>

<p>It was, however, the head covering that
was at all times the part of oriental dress that
received the greatest attention. At the time
of the conquest the Greeks wore embroidered
or gilt caps, the Turcomans caps of red felt,
and the Ottomans, as a distinction, adopted
white felt caps to be worn by the military
and civil servants. Their shape and the
color of the turbans that encircled them depended
upon the rank and profession of the
wearer; they were of varied form and color,
bright and picturesque, and harmonized well
with the equally variegated and rich pelisses
and kaftans of the Mohammedans. The garments
worn by these dignitaries were of rich
tissues and fine cloths, and consisted of wide
and long <i>shalvars</i>, or trousers, vests, rich
shawls, girdles, and jackets of different
shapes.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, great changes were
introduced into the national dress, which
became extremely rich and costly, abounding
in gold and embroidery. Among the
most striking of these costumes was that of
the sailors and officers of the navy, which
was of scarlet cloth richly worked with gold.</p>

<p>The gradual abandonment of all these
gorgeous costumes by the Ottomans dates
from the time the state began to feel the
weight of the immense expense they caused,
at the beginning of the present century. The
uniforms of the army and navy were
changed, and the European style began to
be adopted by the Sultan and by the civil
employés; and the fashion was gradually
introduced among the townspeople of all nationalities.</p>

<p>The present costume of the upper class of
Turks is a European frock-coat buttoned up
to the throat, European trousers, and the fez—sole
relic of the old dress. The uniforms
of government officers, according to their
rank, are richly embroidered, and on great
occasions covered with decorations and precious
stones.</p>

<p>The Ottomans illustrate their love of display
and wealth by a proverb which says:
“<i>Akli Frengistan, Mali Hindustan, Saltanat
Ali Osman</i>,”—“Mind is the gift of the
European, wealth that of the Hindoo, and
pomp that of the Osmanli.”</p>

<p>The peasants and poorer orders of the
Turks have to a great extent adhered to their
primitive costume, which is principally
composed of coarse woollen and linen stuffs;
those among the well-to-do, who still adhere
to this style of dress, make a great display of
gold and silk embroidery; the turban, however,
has for the most part been abandoned
in the towns, and replaced by the fez, worn
by all classes.</p>

<p>The dress of the majority of the Ulema and
Softas has changed only with respect to the
turban, which has been reduced and made of
uniform size, and to the materials of the
dress, which are now less costly than
formerly and of European manufacture.
Those members of these orders who belong
to “La jeune Turquie” have modified their
dress by the adoption of European articles of
apparel which they wear under their <i>jubbé</i>,
or pelisse.</p>

<p>The ancient in-door costume worn by ladies
of rank consisted of a gown of cloth or damask
silk, embroidered with bouquets of flowers
wrought in silk, with a border of similar
workmanship. Opening upon the breast, it
displayed a handsome silk gauze shirt, the
sleeves of which hung loosely at the wrists,
surmounted by a velvet jacket, richly
worked with gold thread. The round, flat
cap worn on the head was covered with
pearls and precious stones; the shoes or slippers
were equally adorned with embroidery
and jewels.</p>

<p>The garments that served to shelter the
form of the Turkish lady from the public
gaze when walking or riding abroad consisted
first of a piece of white muslin placed over
the head and coming down to the eyes;
another and larger piece was placed over the
mouth, covering the lower part of the nose,
and secured at the back of the head. This
covered the neck and chest, and hung some
distance down the back. A cloak of cloth,
silk, merino, or some lighter fabric, covered
the whole person; a rectangular piece, which
hung from the shoulders and reached nearly
to the ground, completely hid the form of
the wearer. The trousers, drawn up a little
above the ankle, did not appear. The yellow
morocco boot was worn under a golosh of
the same color.</p>

<p>In some parts of Asia Minor a black shade,
made of horsehair, covers the eyes, and the
head is thickly enveloped in calico coverings,
no part of the face being visible. The
<i>Mahrama</i> is also frequently seen in all parts
of Turkey. This consists of a large piece of
colored stuff fastened at the waist and brought
over the head; the face is covered with a
colored silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>The <i>yashmak</i> (veil) and <i>feridjé</i> (cloak) are
universally worn by Turkish women of all
classes out of doors. The former varies, according
to the rank and place of residence of
the wearers, from ordinary calico to the
finest tarlatan, while the latter may be of
almost any material or color. Green, the
color of the Prophet’s garments, is sacred to
the Mohammedans, and only a certain branch
of the Turkish family is entitled to wear it
on their heads. Those of both sexes that enjoy
this privilege are called <i>Mollahs</i>. Green
<i>feridjés</i> can, however, be indiscriminately
used by Mohammedan women, and the preference
for this color is so strongly marked in
some localities that cloaks of other hues are
seldom seen. In the town of Broussa, for
instance, many years ago, the dark green
<i>feridjé</i>, with a square veil of coarse linen enveloping
the head, and tied under the chin
over another piece covering the mouth, was
the favorite out-of-door costume of all classes.
During a visit that Sultan Abdul-Medjid paid
to this town, the whole population turned out
and lined the sides of the road during his entry.
The mass of Turkish women, distinguishable
from a certain distance, presented
a peculiar spectacle, which drew from the
Sultan the following unromantic remark on
the veiled beauties who were impatiently
waiting to gaze upon the Padishah: “The
hanoums of Broussa may be famous for their
personal charms and beauty; but thus
equipped and grouped their Padishah has
seen little in them, and can only compare
them to a field of spinach dotted with snowflakes!”</p>

<p>The clothing of the women of the lower
class is generally of coarse printed calico,
of which they make quilted jackets and undergarments,
but as a rule they appear very
thinly clad, and their apparel is made of such
poor material that it seems almost transparent.
The children usually wear long quilted
cotton jackets fastened round the waist by a
<i>chevré</i>, or worked handkerchief, but strings
and buttons seem to be almost unknown.
Men’s garments are generally made in the
public shops, and both cut out and sewed by
men. The shirt and drawers are perfectly
loose, and would fit equally well almost anybody.
The trousers consist of a long piece of
cloth folded, with the ends sewed together, as
well as one side, with the exception of two
openings left at the corners for introducing
the feet; it is in fact a bag, pure and simple,
with two holes at the bottom corners, and
open at the top. The vests of the men are
made of striped cloth and have long tight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
sleeves; the girdle is a shawl bound tightly
round the waist. The jacket has various
forms. It is short, with sleeves coming
down only to the elbows; or these extend
to, or even beyond, the hand, and are close,
or slit open from the shoulder down; they
may be buttoned, left to hang loosely, or tied
in a knot behind the back. In every case
Oriental clothing lies in folds about the person,
but easy locomotion, or the free use of
the limbs, is impossible.</p>

<p>The transformations in dress among Turkish
ladies, both with regard to material and
fashion, are most disadvantageous. Among
the higher orders the European dress has
been adopted for in-door wear, resulting in
extravagance, bad taste, and incongruity.
The description of one or two of the least
striking of these toilettes will suffice to give
some idea of the manner in which Parisian
fashions are generally understood and worn
by Turkish ladies. Last year, when paying
a visit to the wife of the Governor-General
of P⸺, I found that lady with her hair uncombed,
wearing a red cotton dressing gown
made in the <i>princesse</i> style. Over this was a
yellow satin jacket, secured round the waist
by a gold belt. Round her neck was a <i>collier</i>
of the rarest pink coral of most perfect workmanship.
When this lady returned my call,
a very large quantity of fine jewellery was
displayed on her person, but her dress was so
badly made and ill-assorted as to make her
pretty little person bear a great resemblance
to that of a polichinelle. Madame F. Pasha,
who succeeded her shortly afterwards,
offered a still more grotesque and ludicrous
picture, both in her own person and in those
of the suite of slaves and companions that
accompanied her. She was very plain and
of a certain age; her costume consisted of a
skirt of common crimson silk with yellow
velvet trimmings, surmounted by a blue
jacket braided with violet. Round her neck
was a scarlet tie, and on her head an orange-colored
<i>bashbagh</i>, or turban, with diamonds
and brilliants enough to represent all the
bright luminaries of heaven.</p>

<p>Her little daughter, a child of seven, wore
a red cotton skirt, with a quilted jacket of
violet silk, and a European hat, in which
pink and white satin ribbons predominated.
Some of her ladies-in-waiting wore tarlatan
dresses over dirty tumbled skirts which had
been washed at some remote date and all the
tucks ironed the wrong way. The wife of
another pasha, after taking off her feridjé,
as is usual on paying calls, disclosed a wrapper
made of common chintz, of a gaudy pattern,
such as is commonly used for furniture-covers.
The length of this robe, however,
was insufficient to conceal an exceedingly
dirty though most elaborate cambric petticoat
of Parisian make.</p>

<p>The <i>chaussure</i> of Turkish ladies, be it of
the last French fashion, or of the oriental
make and covered with gems and embroidery,
never fits well, nor is properly worn. Their
stockings are never darned, and are used till
they fall to pieces; as to the manner in which
they are secured the less said the better; it is
very improbable that this part of a Turkish
beauty’s raiment will ever have the chance
of instituting a second Order of the Garter.
After contemplating this disparaging but true
picture of a modern Turkish lady’s dress,
the readers will doubtless agree with me in
preferring the elegant costume of the old-fashioned
class, or the white <i>gedjlik</i>, still a
popular négligé costume, with the bare white
feet half hidden by a pretty oriental slipper.
These, together with the characteristic
<i>shalvar</i>, <i>intari</i>, and <i>koushak</i>, and the graceful
<i>fotoz</i> that surmounted the abundant locks
which fell in multitudinous tresses over the
shoulders of the Turkish lady of other days,
gave her a <i>cachet</i> of distinction entirely lost
in the present day.</p>

<p>After the conquest strict laws were issued
as to the form of the head-coverings to be
worn by the rayahs, determining their shape
and color, and the form of the shoes and
<i>kaftans</i> in particular. The <i>kalpak</i>, or hat,
was black, and in the shape of an immense
pumpkin or miniature balloon. The <i>kaftan</i>
also differed in form and color from that
worn by Mussulmans; and the shoes were
black, or of a dark plum-color. No exterior
sign of luxury or wealth was allowed out of
doors.</p>

<p>As fashion and custom changed, these regulations
fell into disregard, and each race in
towns may now dress as it chooses, and
adopt its national costume or European garments
without exciting either surprise or disapproval.
Generally speaking, it is the use
of the latter raiment that has acquired ascendency
among townspeople, and the national
costume is more peculiar to the peasantry,
and varies according to nationality in
elegance and comfort, but never changes its
original form.</p>

<p>The Turkish peasant adheres to his extensive
turban, and seldom exchanges it for the
more simple fez; the Greek continues to
wear his wide <i>vrakiá</i> and blue <i>servéta</i>; and
the Bulgarian his <i>potour</i> and <i>gougla</i> (black
sheepskin cap). The Armenian is still attired
in his long <i>jubbé</i>, or loose coat and blue
turban, and the Jew in his floating robes of
immemorial form. Some years ago a Turkish peasant
from one of the towns of the interior
visited the capital. On his return I
asked him what he had seen there to strike
his fancy. “What did I see?” replied the
good old fellow, stroking his beard in dismay.
“I was astonished to see the deformity
of human nature in that great city; the
women now have two heads, one planted on
the top of the other, and the hump, which
we in our village consider a terrible calamity,
seems to be a general affliction, but has descended
much below the shoulders! May
Allah have mercy upon us; but such preposterous
changes as these must to a certainty
be the signs of bad times!” The sensible
man alluded to the enormous chignons and
tournures then in fashion, and perhaps he
was not far wrong in his ideas.</p>

<p>Fashions, like coins, will penetrate everywhere
and find currency among the most
savage, who are glad to purchase finery at
any cost. Eighteen years ago, when I first
visited the town of N⸺ in Upper Albania,
I was honored by visits from the wives of
all the dignitaries of the town. The first
batch of callers consisted of about twenty
ladies, whose arrival was announced to me
at six o’clock in the morning, and who could
with difficulty be persuaded by my people
that the Franks were always in their beds at
that time, and received at a much later hour
of the day. “Well, if that is the <i>Inglis
moda</i>, we too must adopt it!” said the most
enlightened lady. By the time they again
appeared I was quite ready to receive them,
and not a little curious to see what kind of
birds these were that had flocked together so
early to visit me. In the mean time, as a
great admirer and reader of the works of
Lord Byron, I had formed all kinds of conjectures
with regard to the lovely faces and
picturesque costumes I was going to see.
The fair maid of Athens, and numberless
other beauties, flitted before my imagination
when a heavy tramp of feet (not at all fairy-like)
up the stairs, preceded by the announcement
that the ladies of the Chorbadjis had
arrived, brought me back to reality, and I
advanced to receive my guests. And now,
what was the spectacle that met my gaze and
deprived me of all control over my risible
propensities? A display of Parisian articles
of dress applied in the most indiscriminate
manner, without any regard to the use for
which they were manufactured and the sex
of the persons for whom they were designed!
Stiff black satin stocks encircled the fair
necks of some of the ladies, assorting queerly
with their graceful and rich national costume,
and making an ugly separation between
their head-dresses and the fine white
crape chemisettes that veiled so much of their
necks as was left uncovered by elaborately
embroidered vests. Below this vest were the
graceful floating scarlet trousers, that should
have fallen to the ground like a skirt, secured
only round the ankle by an embroidered cuff;
but all the beauty and grace of this garment
were lost in the expansion caused by a monstrous
cage crinoline introduced within it,
which gave the otherwise sylph-like figures
of the wearers the appearance of a shapeless
balloon supported on large pairs of gentlemen’s
patent-leather boots, proudly displayed!</p>

<p>The costumes worn in the towns of Thessaly,
Epirus, and part of Macedonia are half
Greek and half Albanian. They comprise a
variety of forms, all more or less original and
picturesque. The headgear of the men is
usually the small Turkish fez, surmounted
by a blue tassel; the wider and longer Greek
fez is also worn, falling with its long tassel
on one side of the head. The tight braided
vest and jacket with hanging sleeves over a
white linen shirt form the upper part of the
dress; the lower comprises the <i>fustanella</i>, or
white kilt, or the wide and long <i>vrakiá</i>, descending
to the ankle, or only covering the
knee, terminated by tight gaiters of braided
cloth. The <i>servéta</i>, or silk girdle, is generally
of a bright color, and often richly embroidered
with gold and silk thread. Those worn
by the peasantry are frequently of gray
tweed worked with darker braid, and the
<i>fustanella</i> is replaced by a linen blouse worn
over a pair of short trousers; gaiters and
pointed shoes or sandals complete the dress.</p>

<p>The costume worn by the women varies
according to the locality, but is always very
graceful and pretty. The head-dress consists
of a flat cloth or felt cap encircled by
embroidered velvet, rows of coins, or other
ornaments, or by a thick braid of hair. The
centre is often occupied by a large pearl
ornament. This cap is worn on one side,
and the hair under it is parted in the centre
and smoothly brushed over the ears, plaited,
or allowed to hang loose.</p>

<p>The upper part of the body is inclosed in
a tight short-waisted bodice, open in front,
down to the middle of the chest, over a fine
gauze chemisette crossed over the bosom; a
short and full skirt, or shalvar, and belt of
various patterns and materials are worn in
the house. Out of doors a long jacket
is worn, fitting tightly to the figure and
reaching nearly to the feet; it is generally
made of fine cloth, plain, or richly embroidered
with gold, and invariably lined with
fur; a colored kerchief, carelessly thrown
over the head, completes the costume. The
tissues used for these garments are of silk,
cotton, and wool, enlivened by silken and
other embroidery.</p>

<p>The dress of the peasants is very similar,
except that it is made of coarser materials, is
plainer, and comprises a great variety of
bright colors.</p>

<p>The dress of the Bulgarian women varies
according to the locality. North of the Balkans
it is entirely national, and has a picturesque
appearance, but is heavy and incommodious
to the wearer, while that of the men,
though more simple and convenient, is by no
means elegant; the only part of it to which
some attention is paid in the rural districts is
the blouse, which is carefully and elaborately
embroidered round the collar and wide
sleeves. In Macedonia this attention is extended
to the white turban, which replaces
the <i>gougla</i>. This is a long towel, the ends
embroidered in tapestry stitch, which is
twisted round the red fez, and one end allowed
to fall on the collar, hiding in part the
long and dishevelled hair allowed to grow
at the back of the head. This tuft of hair is
sometimes plaited, and bears a great resemblance
to the Chinese coiffure. On feast-days
a flower is placed in the turban. The Bulgarians
of the towns have adopted a more
Europeanized costume made of <i>shayak</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
thick native cloth. These home-woven fabrics
are very substantial, and sometimes the
gray and white are beautiful, but the rest are
ugly, especially the shot and striped ones,
on account of the colors being badly assorted.
The Bulgarian townspeople generally choose
these stuffs for their garments, and add to
their unbecomingness by the uncouth shapes
in which they cut them, the trousers being
always either too short or too loose, and the
coats and vests most shapeless and slovenly.
This description does not of course include
the higher classes, who pay great attention
to their toilettes.</p>

<p>What is principally wanting in these national
costumes is the being adapted to the
occasions on which they are worn. For example,
for every-day wear both sexes choose
their plainest suits, and keep them on from
morning till night, whether in the field or in
the house. The gala costumes are of fine
cloth, or still more delicate material, and are
donned on feast-days and other great occasions,
and once put on are worn all day long,
getting covered with dust out of doors, and
yet serving for the soirée and the dance.</p>

<p>This incongruity also extends to season.
The uniform long jackets lined with fur are
worn by the women in winter and in the heat
of a long summer’s day.</p>

<p>There is no evening dress comprised in the
wardrobe of an Oriental. The refinements
of society have prescribed none but that
which his easy-going and indolent life claims
from him, viz., his gedjlik, or dressing-gown.
The Turk, the Armenian, and the native
Jew alike put on this no doubt delightfully
comfortable, but by no means elegant, garment
immediately on re-entering the bosom
of their families after the labors of the day
are concluded. This custom is so prevalent
among the Turks that as soon as the return
of the <i>bey</i> or <i>effendi</i> is announced the wife
unfolds the wrapper and holds it ready for
him to put on. This attire is sometimes rendered
still more négligé by a complete exchange
of the day dress for that commonly
appropriate for use at night. The bey or
pasha may return to the Selamlik so attired,
and receive his visitors there, should they be
of equal or inferior rank to himself; but if
of higher rank he must receive them in his
day costume.</p>

<p>The adoption of the European dress has
everywhere created a display of bad taste.
On first changing their costume, the natives
proudly profess a great partiality for it, and
call themselves followers of the “à la
Franca,” or Frank fashions. Those few
who possess some education alone make the
change without grievously shocking the taste
of their European neighbors.</p>

<p>A few instances of the manner in which
“Frank” dress and etiquette are understood
by the majority will give the reader a better
idea than any explanation on the subject.</p>

<p>I was present at an Armenian wedding,
when the house was crowded by a large company
composed of both sexes. The ladies,
however, had almost monopolized the drawing-room,
which was furnished with long
Turkish sofas running round the walls on
three sides, occupied by three rows of ladies.
The first row were seated on the cushions, the
second sat cross-legged in front, and the third
contented themselves with the extreme edge,
while some other ladies and a few of the
other sex were favored with chairs, or walked
about the room. I had prudently possessed
myself of a chair, and placed it in a position
to have a good <i>coup d’œil</i> of the scene, and
be near enough to the sofa to hear and join
in the conversation of some of its occupants.
It was by no means an uninteresting sight;
there was the bride, the queen of the fête,
seated on a pile of cushions in the corner reserved
for her, surrounded by the triple line
of ladies representing all ages, types, and
fashions. The dark and unassuming attire
of the aged pleasingly contrasted with the
gay dresses of the young and pretty, radiant
with the glitter of jewelry and the sparkle of
many pairs of bright black eyes that frequently
met and questioned each other; a
not unpleasant way of making up for the
oriental laconism generally observed in large
assemblies, when conversation is carried on
in low tones, and generally consists only of
a passing joke or criticism on the appearance
of others of the company. Some of these
remarks I found very amusing; for instance,
a thin, yellow brunette said to her neighbor,
“Doudou, do you notice how stiff and
stately Mariemme Hanoum sits in her new
polka? Her husband, Baron Carabet,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who
has just returned from Constantinople, has
brought her a machine made of whalebone
and steel, in which the Franks cage their
wives in order to fill up what is missing and
tone down what is superfluous.” “Chok
shay!”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> exclaimed her companion, an exceedingly
stout lady, casting a hasty glance
over her voluminous person. “I wonder if
the like is to be found in the <i>charshi</i> (bazar),
so many articles of dress have lately been
brought from Europe by one of the shopkeepers!”</p>

<p>This conversation was brought to an abrupt
termination by the exclamation of
“Ouff! Aman!” from a third lady who was
sitting cross-legged, and evidently in an uncomfortable
position. “Ouff! Aman!” she
repeated, stretching out her feet as far as possible,
and then proceeded to pull off her
socks, quietly folded them up, and put them
in her pocket. She was an elderly lady, evidently
of the old school, for her proceedings
shocked one much younger than herself
seated near, and provoked from her some
remark on the impropriety she had committed.
The old lady, however, could not
be prevailed upon to see it, and replied very
quietly:</p>

<p>“Kesim, what does it matter? all now is
‘à la Franca,’ and we may do as we please!”</p>

<p>Incidents of European fashions, completely
distorted into alarming caricatures,
are still very frequent, and, what is more
serious, are often accompanied by so great
an absence of all knowledge of the rules of
good breeding that everything out of the
common, however free or strange it may be,
is put down to the “à la Franca,” or European
liberty. Only two years ago, at a ball
given by one of my friends, a functionary of
the Porte, Armenian by birth, coolly entered
the boudoir, pulled off his boots, which were,
it appears, too tight for him, and seated himself
on a sofa smoking his cigarette. This
gentleman was requested by the host to resume
his chaussure and withdraw from the
house; and yet civilized notions had so far
penetrated the somewhat dull imagination of
this <i>Effendi</i> as to have induced him to use
visiting-cards upon which was engraved, together
with his name, his title of “Membre
perpétuel de la Justice,” surmounted by a
gilt pair of scales.</p>

<p>Dress and amusement are thought by many
to denote the degree of refinement and mental
development of nations. There is certainly
some truth in this theory, and I have often
allowed my opinion of a people and my belief
in its prosperity and progress to be
guided in some degree by their apparently
most trivial characteristics.</p>

<p>To seek through these means, however, to
arrive at an estimate of the Turkish character
is a somewhat difficult task. The national
costume is disappearing, and is being
replaced by a counterfeit or borrowed attire.
With regard to amusement the difficulty becomes
still greater, for all the games that
were characteristic of the East, such as that
of the <i>Djerid</i>, or throwing the lance on horseback
when galloping at full speed, have fallen
into disuse; together with the now forgotten
races and target-practising in which
the youth of the two towns used to display
their splendid arms and prove their capacity
for manly and warlike pursuits. The grand
hunting parties, in which the grandees and
even the Sultans loved to take part, now
only take place occasionally, headed by some
fine old governor-general of the ancient type.
In such instances the chase becomes most enjoyable
and delightful. Many years ago,
while residing in a country town, I had several
times the pleasure of taking part in these
animated coursing parties organized by the
governor of the town, and headed by him in
person. The company would sometimes
consist of twenty cavaliers, with an equal
number of mounted attendants leading the
<i>capon</i>, or fine greyhounds peculiar to Albania.
Proceeding at first in a compact body across
the hills, down on the fertile plains on the
borders of the Maritza, as we neared the open
country and descended the slopes, the cavalcade
dispersed, the fiery horses could scarcely
be controlled, and the dogs, trembling with
excitement, strove to break from the leashes.
The sportsmen in their variegated costumes,
stimulated by their surroundings, lost their air
of lassitude and torpor, and appeared like the
traditional Osmanli of old. The scattered
band of cavaliers would explore the ground
until the frightened and startled animals,
driven out of their haunts, would after a few
bounds come to a dead stop, and then flee,
pursued by the hounds and followed by the
hunters.</p>

<p>There was something so animating in the
whole scene that even a timid woman might
have disregarded the danger of fracturing
her collar-bone and willingly taken part in
it.</p>

<p>The other excursions, carried on with equal
spirit, consist of battues of large and small
game, which take place on the estates of the
beys, who issue invitations to their friends,
throw open the gates of their chiftliks or
farms, and receive visitors with every mark
of hospitality. At dawn the whole party assembles
at the appointed place, previously
surrounded by the tenants and laborers belonging
to the property, who beat in the
game.</p>

<p>These parties, I am assured, are much appreciated
by European sportsmen, who enjoy
the wildness of the scenery, as well as the
shyness of the birds, which, unlike their preserved
kinsfolk in England, are complete
strangers to contact with man in their unfrequented
forests and plains.</p>

<p>An interest is still evinced by all classes in
the wrestling matches which are usually held
on the commons outside the towns. On
these occasions the greater part of the population
turns out and seats itself in a closely-packed
circle. The combatants, stripped to
the waist, enter the ring, encouraged by the
crowd; closely watching each other’s movements,
each awaits a favorable opportunity
for seizing his antagonist, whom, by a dexterous
catch, he hopes to throw. No animosity
is displayed by any of the rivals,
be they Turks, Christians, or gypsies. The
spectators take a deep interest in these contests,
but seldom express their approbation
or disapproval in a very marked manner.</p>

<p>Minstrels still play a prominent part among
all classes of the Turkish population. These
are professional artists, well versed in improvisation,
and skilful players on musical
instruments, especially the <i>Kanoun</i>, a species
of zither, for which a great partiality is
displayed. Whatever their nationality, they
are as welcome in the Konaks of the highest
dignitaries as among the crowds that flock
on Fridays and other holidays to some <i>café</i>,
where, seated in a prominent place, the bard
pours forth his strains or relates his <i>massal</i>
(story), which generally turns upon love,
and, though wanting neither in interest nor
brilliancy, is accompanied by unpleasant gesticulation,
and is hardly meet either for the
ears or the eyes of the young.</p>

<p>When I was in Albania, the Mushir of
Roumelia, with his <i>corps d’armée</i>, passed
through the town, and as a mark of civility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
sent his minstrel to my house to enliven me
with his performance. Oriental music, however,
has not as a rule an enlivening effect
upon Europeans. But there is a pensiveness
and a sadness in it that to me have an irresistible
charm.</p>

<p>Another amusement is that of the Kara
Guez and Hadji Eyvat, a kind of Punch and
Judy. This is a most indecent representation,
and the language that accompanies it is
quite in harmony with the scenes; but it
greatly delights the Turkish ladies, for whose
diversion it is frequently introduced into the
harems. To this class of recreation may be
added the obscene <i>Kucheks</i>, or dancing women
and boys; the <i>Mukkalits</i>, or clowns, who
amuse the company with their jests; the
<i>Meydan Oyoun</i>, or comic plays held in the
open air; the performing monkeys and bears,
trained by hardy Pomaks or gypsies, who
lead these creatures from town to town, and
force them to display the accomplishments
they have learned under the discipline of the
lash.</p>

<p>What a Turk heartily enjoys is his pipe
and coffee, sitting by the side of a running
stream or in some spot commanding a fine
view. This quiescent pleasure he calls
“taking <i>Kaif</i>.” On the whole, his capacity
for enjoyment is rather of a passive than an
active kind.</p>

<p>Clubs, reading-rooms, or other resorts for
social and intellectual improvement are quite
unknown among the Turks. Their place is,
however, filled to some extent by the old-fashioned
<i>café</i> for the Osmanli of mature age,
and by the Casinos and other places of the
same doubtful character for “La jeune Turquie,”
who <i>faute de mieux</i> resort thither to
enjoy the delights of taking their <i>raki</i>, or
sometimes ruining themselves by indulging in
<i>rouge et noir</i> or other games of chance which
they do not understand, and, to do them justice,
do not as a rule largely indulge in.</p>

<p>The amusements of the Rayahs are neither
very brilliant nor very varied, but they are
part of a more healthy social life, and serve
as a point of union between the sexes, increasing
the joys and pleasures of home existence,
whose monotony they do not often
interrupt. The great delight of these people
is the national dances of the Greeks, Bulgarians,
Armenians, and Jews, always gladly
indulged in when a chance offers. Such opportunities
are generally weddings and great
feast-days, and carnival time. With the
Jews and Armenians it is an insipid formality,
and the similarity of the costume of the
women, who alone indulge in it, the want of
variety in the step, and the dull and graceless
manner in which it is performed, deprive it
of any claim to be called an amusement.
But with the Greeks and Bulgarians it is
quite a different matter; both enter into it
with a zest and animation delightful to witness.
The Greeks collect in a ring to dance
the <i>surto</i> of immemorial date. Holding each
other by the hand, and led by the most agile
youth and maiden, who hold the corners of
a handkerchief, they perform a variety of
measured steps and evolutions, while the
surrounding ring execute a step to the sound
of the music that accompanies the dance. All
the movements are graceful, and performed
with precision, at some times becoming more
animated, and at others falling back into a
slow measured step. The ring breaks at intervals
and allows those wishing to retire to
do so, or receives fresh additions from the
outsiders.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian <i>hora</i> is performed to the
sound of the <i>gaida</i>, or bagpipe. The sounds of
this instrument act like magic upon these gay
and pleasure-loving people, who no sooner
hear its discordant groans than, forming into
a circle and holding each other by the belt,
they begin to stamp and turn round in an
earnest and excited manner, appearing thoroughly
absorbed in the performance.</p>

<p>There is a second kind of dance in which
the Bulgarians take great pleasure, that
known as the “bear dance.” It is performed
by a man dressed in a bearskin, who
presents himself to the company, led by a
pretty girl, who makes him perform all kinds
of pranks and buffooneries, greatly to the enjoyment
of the spectators, who occasionally
join in the dance and give chase to the bear.
I do not think it is possible to find a people
who can enjoy more heartily the wild music
of the <i>gaida</i> than the Bulgarian, or enter
more enthusiastically into the dance than he
does. With the Greeks, dancing is reserved
for appointed times and seasons, but the Bulgarian,
be he in the field or resting on the
common on a Prasnik day, will come forward
and indulge in it as his greatest delight.</p>

<p>After the dance come the small pleasure
parties, for which families club together and
go to spend a few days in some picturesque
village or hospitable monastery, or to some
wild watering-place, where they can enjoy
the baths to their hearts’ content. The mineral
springs are encircled by the remains of
magnificent old Roman baths, roofless for the
most part, but evidently indestructible so far
as the splendid marble basins that receive the
water are concerned.</p>

<p>Every saint seems, by some ubiquitous
means, to possess a shrine in every town,
village, or monastery. To these all the people
resort on their anniversaries, attired in
their best, to see and to be seen, and any person,
be it man, woman, or child, bearing the
name of the saint, is visited by all its friends
and relatives during the day; generally speaking,
a party is given in the evening, where,
if instrumental music and dancing do not
form part of the entertainment, a variety of
round games, cards, vocal music, and other
similar diversions, are had recourse to. Divers
refreshments, in the form of excellent
native wine, fruit, and cakes, are offered
during the evening after the formal handing
round of <i>glico</i> and coffee. These gatherings,
often kept up to a late hour, always conclude
peacefully, and cases of disorder and drunkenness
are unheard of, and indeed are of rare
occurrence at any time, excepting at a late
hour at the place where a fair is held, when
a few <i>mauvais sujets</i> may remain behind in a
disorderly frame of mind.</p>

<p>This description refers only to the working
classes and tradespeople. Among the better
educated classes music, conversation,
theatricals, and in fact almost everything
that belongs to European society is included,
although, as may be supposed, deficiencies
as to dress, etiquette, and other details are
to be remarked in the provinces; but a
marked desire for improvement, especially
among the Greeks, is everywhere noticeable.
Each community, however, keeps within its
own circle, a drawback that renders the society
limited and prevents the sociable feeling
that should prevail among them.</p>

</div>

<p>The Turks generally marry early, from
seventeen for the men, and from eleven for
the girls—who all marry, so that an old
maid, like many other European institutions,
is absolutely unknown in Turkey. This
custom of early marriages is encouraged by
parents as a check upon their sons contracting
wild habits. It may in this respect have
the desired effect, but must be very injurious
in every other. How can a youth of seventeen
or twenty, whose studies, if he by
chance has pursued any, are not finished,
whose career in life is yet to begin, assume
the weight of a family without morally and
physically suffering for it? Ambition, the
mainspring of a young man’s exertions,
damped by the early contraction of sedentary
habits, soon degenerates into listless indifference.
The intellectual faculties, crossed in
the pursuit of knowledge by a current of
ideas and responsibilities totally foreign to
them, are checked before they have had their
due course; while, physically speaking, harem
life, bad at all the stages of the life of
a Turk among the higher orders, must be incalculably
worse when entered upon so early.</p>

<p>The <i>Nekyah</i>, or betrothal, comprises the
fiançailles as well as the matrimonial contract.
The preliminaries of the engagement are undertaken
by the parents of the contracting
parties. The mother or some near relative
of the young man, in company with a few of
her friends and the <i>Koulavouz</i>, starts on a tour
of inspection, visiting families known to possess
marriageable daughters. The object of
the visit being made known, they are admitted,
and the eldest girl presents herself, offers
coffee, kisses hands all round, waits to take
the empty cups, and then disappears, her inspectors
having to content themselves with
the short view they have thus had of her.
Should this prove satisfactory, they at once
enter into negotiations, make inquiries as to
the age and dowry of the girl, answer counter-inquiries
on the condition of the youth,
and say that, if it be agreeable to both parties
and it is <i>Kismet</i> that the marriage should
take place, they will come again and make
the final arrangements. On the mother’s return
home, she gives a faithful description of
the maiden’s appearance to her son, and
should this meet with his approval, the intermediaries
are commissioned to settle all preliminaries.</p>

<p>The dowry is, of course, among Muslims
given by the bridegroom; the only dowry
Turkish brides are bound to bring consists
in a rich <i>trousseau</i>. Should the lady possess
any property the husband cannot assume any
right over it, nor over any of the rest of her
belongings. The wisdom and generosity of
this law cannot be too highly commended;
it is an indispensable clause in the canons of
polygamy. So easy is it for a Turk to
divorce his wife that he has only to say to
her in a moment of anger, “Cover thy face,
thy <i>nekyah</i> is in thy hands,” and she ceases
to be his wife, and must at once leave his
abode, carrying with her, luckily for her,
“bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>The privileges of divorce thus indulgently
permitted to a man are entirely beyond the
reach of a woman, whom no human power
can release from her <i>nekyah</i> vows without
her husband’s free consent. And even if she
gain her husband’s consent to a divorce, she
thereby loses her dowry and <i>trousseau</i>, which
she would retain if divorced not of her own
motion. This unfair restriction gives rise to
many unhappy disputes, issuing in litigation
which ever proves vain and fruitless against
the obstinacy of the husband or, even worse,
his helplessness, should he become insane;
for a lunatic’s word of divorce cannot count
before the law.</p>

<p>The following sad history of a bride I
knew is a good illustration of the latter case.
The heroine was a fine brunette, the daughter
of Yousuf Bey, a rich and influential personage
in the town of B⸺. A <i>nekyah</i> had
been contracted between her and a young
man rather queer and strange in his manners,
but very wealthy—a consideration which
more than counterbalanced his failings in the
estimation of her avaricious father.</p>

<p>The <i>Duhun</i>, or wedding-day, fixed upon,
the festivities began according to the routine
of pomp and display usual among the wealthy.
As the wedding-day approached the bridegroom
became more and more strange; now
falling into fits of deep melancholy, now into
merriment.</p>

<p>His friends, noticing this, suggested that it
was <i>jahilik</i>, or childishness, occasioned by the
prospect of his approaching happiness, crossed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
by the thought that he had no father to
participate in it, and no mother to second
him in his duties by welcoming his bride to
her future home.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the <i>Duhun</i> went on all
the same; the bride, decked in her splendid
array, arrived at the bridegroom’s house,
and was met, according to custom, by the
bridegroom, who, under the direction of the
<i>Koulavouz</i>, was waiting to conduct her to her
apartment. The emotion of the moment was
too much for his vacillating mind. He fixed
his gaze for a moment upon his bride with a
vacant stare; her face was unknown to him.
The tinsel, the bridal veil, the crowd of <i>hanoums</i>
surrounding her, failed to impress him
with the solemnity of the event his mind no
longer comprehended.</p>

<p>In vain the shrill voice of the <i>Koulavouz</i>
strove to make him understand her repeated
suggestion that he should conduct his bride
upstairs. Her words, confusedly caught,
and mingled with some flickering notion of
what he ought to do, at length urged him to
action. He seized the <i>Koulavouz</i>, a frightful
old witch, passed her arm through his, and
with the determination and obstinacy of the
madman led her upstairs and placed her in
the bridal bower. A miserable scene of confusion
ensued. The poor bride, faint and
sick at heart, re-entered her coach and hurried
back to the paternal roof, while the <i>hanoums</i>
made a rush towards their <i>yashmaks</i>
and <i>feridjés</i>, dismayed at the misfortune and
alarmed by the screams of the old <i>Koulavouz</i>,
who was making frantic efforts to release
herself from the tight embrace of the maniac.
Help from the Selamlik soon arrived, and the
madman was secured.</p>

<p>Seven years have elapsed, the unhappy
bride is still pining over her misfortunes and
the loss of the liberty which all efforts have
thus far proved unable to restore to her.</p>

<p>A Turkish husband has the power of
divorcing his wife and taking her back
twice; but should he send her away for the
third time, she must be married to another
man before she can again return to her first
husband. This strange and disgusting law
is meant as a check upon people disposed to
abuse too often the privilege of divorce. The
person asked to fulfil this strange position of
intermediary husband must be advanced in
years, generally belongs to the poorer class,
and receives a sum of money for his services.
The conditions are that he should enter the
abode of the lady for one night only, with
every right over her of a legal husband, and
quit it the next morning, telling her, “Thy
liberty is in thy hands, thou art no longer
my wife.” Cases have been known when
the old gentleman, finding his position pleasant,
has refused to give the lady up, and if
this should happen the first husband is wholly
without remedy, and must forego his desire
of reunion with his former wife.</p>

<p>An incident of the kind happened at Adrianople,
affording much merriment to my
Turkish friends. The couple concerned
were very fond of each other, and lived happily
together except at times, when the husband,
under the influence of <i>raki</i>, would become
quarrelsome. The wife, a fine spirited
woman, would retort, and violent disputes
followed, ending in alternate divorce and
reconciliation. This happening once too
often, the husband, unable to repossess himself
of his spouse, had recourse to an old
<i>effendi</i> who had seen better days, and promised
£20 for his services. The <i>effendi</i>, according
to custom, went to the bath, dressed
himself in a new suit of clothes, and being
presented at the appointed time, the <i>nekyah</i>
ceremony was gone through. The old gentleman
walked into the harem, seated himself
upon the lady’s sofa, and began to enjoy,
through the fumes of his nargilé, the
sweet vision of his unlooked-for happiness;
while the lady, whose dreams did not exactly
harmonize with his, after offering the acquaintance-cup
of coffee, generally shared
by the wife on such an occasion, preferred
standing at a respectful distance. The old
effendi, however, would not be balked in
the prospect he had formed for the re-enjoyment
of his former happier days. Why
should he not prolong the tenure of the rights
thus unexpectedly devolving upon him?
Nothing hindered but his pledged word to
renounce them on the following morning.
His conscience easily reconciled to this
breach of faith, he decided upon remaining
master of the situation, leaving the poor husband
to lament the loss of his wife and his
£20, and quite regardless of the useless burden
he would become to the doubly-injured
lady. Such events, however, are not of frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>It is customary for the bridegroom to furnish
the wedding-dress and sundry other accessories,
as well as to promise the <i>nekyah</i>
money settled upon the wife in case of divorce.
These, including the <i>Kaftan</i> (outer
wedding dress) are sent with great pomp
eight days before the <i>Duhun</i>. The Hodja,
priest of the parish in which the parents of
the girl reside, is requested to give a declaration
that the young lady is free to contract
matrimony. This, taken to the Kadi, obtains
the marriage license, for which a small
fee is paid. A piece of red silk and some
sugar-plums are taken by the bridegroom’s
mother to the house of the bride. The red
silk, which later on is made into an under-garment,
is spread on this occasion on the
floor; upon it the young lady steps to kiss
the hand of her future mother-in-law and
receive the gift with her blessing.</p>

<p>Half of one of these sugar-plums, bitten in
two by her pearly teeth, is taken to the bridegroom
as the first love token; literal sweetness
in this case making up for any fault in
the sentiment. These preliminaries are sealed
by the formality performed by the Imam in
the presence of witnesses who are called to
the door of the Haremlik, behind which the
maiden and her friends stand. The Imam
asks the bride if she consents to accept the
youth proposed (giving his name) for her
husband. The question is repeated three
times, the bride answering each time in the
affirmative. The Hodja has to declare the
amount of the <i>nekyah</i> money promised, and
calls three times upon the bystanders to bear
witness before God to the contract; a short
prayer follows, and the ceremony is concluded.
The felicitations are conveyed in the
poetical expression of “May Allah grant harmony
between their two stars!” The contract,
religious as well as civil, is made verbally,
and though no other ceremony of importance
follows it, the bride and bridegroom
do not see each other till the <i>Duhun</i>, or wedding
festivities, have been held. The length
of this period may be from a few weeks to a
few years, and is a blank which potential
love is at liberty to fill with fantastic pictures
of coming happiness. No sweet messages,
letters, or communications of any kind are allowed
during the interval to pave the way
towards the future binding together of two
beings whose common lot is cast, without
regard to personal sympathy, into the vague
abyss of destiny. Kismet, the supreme ruler
of all Turkish events, is left to decide the degree
of misery or indifference that marriage
contracted under such unfavorable circumstances
may bring, instead of the looked-for
happiness.</p>

<p>Romance, ending in marriage, however, is
not unknown between Turkish youths and
maidens, and the parents seldom refuse their
consent in such cases. Young love, even
Turkish love, is sometimes strong enough to
break through the barriers of harem restraint
and reach its object in spite of every obstacle
with which the organization of centuries of
jealous guardianship has surrounded Turkish
women.</p>

<p>At Adrianople, a young beauty of sixteen
suddenly began to pine and sicken. The
color faded from her cheeks, she became
thoughtful, sad, and listless; a low fever set
in, greatly alarming the anxious parents, who
were at a loss to divine the cause. As usual,
all the learned Hodjas were resorted to, but
their <i>Muskas</i>, prayers, and blessings failed to
revive the sinking health and spirits of the
maiden. One day I happened to visit this
family; the girl was seated at the corner
window, overlooking the street, dreamily gazing
out from behind the lattice. Her little
brother was playing by her side, while the
mother was describing to me the symptoms
of her daughter’s indisposition. The
little fellow suddenly jumped up, saying,
“<i>Ishdé</i> Ali Bey. I want to go to him!”
His sister started up, her cheeks suffused
with blushes, and left the room in confusion.
Both the mother and I noticed the incident,
though no remark was made about it at the
time by either of us; but I was at no loss
then to understand the reason of the girl’s
failing health and depression of spirits. A
short time after I heard of her engagement to
this young man, whom it appears she had
loved as a child. This love later on becoming
a hidden passion was shared by the youth
and stealthily interpreted between them by
the language of flowers, fruits, and scents,
the mediums generally resorted to by Turks
in such cases. The lover, handsome and intelligent,
was a mere <i>Kyatib</i>, who deemed his
limited means an obstacle to his aspiring to
the hand of one of the wealthiest young hanoums
of the town. I was present at the
marriage festivities of this lovely creature,
and saw her a year later a blooming wife and
mother.</p>

<p>The trousseau comprises bedding, sometimes
to the amount of fifty sets, each composed
of two mattresses, two quilted coverlets,
and three cotton bolsters; kitchen utensils,
all of copper, very numerous, consisting
of two or three immense cauldrons, several
large jugs and pans, and a great number of
dinner-trays, with the services belonging to
them; among the wealthy one of these would
be of silver. It also comprises furniture for
two rooms of some rich material embroidered
with gold, a handsome <i>mangal</i> (brazier), curtains,
and a few carpets and rugs, besides the
house linen. The wardrobe contains several
expensive fur jackets, a shawl or two, some
<i>feridjés</i>, and a number of suits of apparel,
consisting of under-gowns and jackets. The
<i>gelinlik</i>, or wedding-dress, ranging in value
from sixty to hundreds of pounds, is embroidered
with gold and pearls. The rest are
less rich in material, and are of silk and
woollen stuffs, and less expensive materials
down to print <i>gedjliks</i>. The other articles
are chemises, a few pairs of stockings, boots,
and slippers, some dozens of worked handkerchiefs,
head-ties, and <i>yashmaks</i>, together
with a number of European odds and ends,
such as petticoats, gloves, and parasols.</p>

<p>The <i>Duhun</i>, like the circumcision ceremony,
lasts a whole week, occasioning great
expense to the parents, who, however, cannot
possibly avoid it, and often incur debts
for its celebration that hang heavily upon
them through life.</p>

<p>The customs connected with weddings
differ according to the district in which they
take place. In Macedonia I was highly
amused to see the manner in which the bride
was introduced into her new home. As soon
as her feet had crossed the threshold, a halter
was thrown round her neck and she was
dragged in by her husband, to teach her an
early lesson of gentle four-footed obedience;
on passing the first hearth-stone her head was
brought into violent contact with the wall, as
a warning of the chastisement she may expect
in case of misconduct.</p>

<p>Her face is a mask of gold-dust and gum
worked on the cheeks, forehead, and chin
with spangles. The eyebrows are thickly
painted and meet over the nose, and the teeth
are blackened. This hideous disguisement is
worn till evening, when the bridegroom, on
his first visit to the bride, pours out the water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
with which she washes it away in order
to give the nuptial kiss.</p>

<p>The wedding festivities begin on the Monday.
A number of friends and relatives collect
at the home of the bride to superintend
the final arrangement and expedition of the
trousseau to the bridegroom’s house. This
luggage is carried by <i>Hammals</i>, who, on arrival
at the house, are entitled beside their
fee to a <i>chevré</i>, or marked handkerchief
offered by the mother. They are preceded
on their march by the <i>Koulavouz</i>, who delivers
their burdens into the charge of the
mother-in-law or some responsible person.
Shortly afterwards, the bride’s party follows,
who after partaking of coffee and bonbons
are shown by the <i>hanoum</i> into the apartments
destined for the occupation of the bride.</p>

<p>It is customary for Turkish youths who
have homes to take their wives to them on
marrying. Should the Konak be too small
to accommodate all the married sons, extra
wings are added to it. The guests, left to
themselves, at once set to work to decorate
the bridal chamber, some stretching strings
along the walls on which to hang the larger
articles of dress, such as furred and embroidered
jackets, <i>feridjés</i>, cloaks, and <i>intaris</i>, all
of bright colors, and richly worked and
trimmed. The shawls, prayer carpet, and
bridal <i>boghcha</i>, all objects of value, occupy
the centre of these rows, which are successively
surmounted by others, consisting of the
linen, kerchiefs, towels, head scarves, and
other adjuncts of the toilet, all arranged with
great taste. Along the top of the walls runs
a garland of crape flowers. The bride’s corner
is richly decorated with these and other
artificial flowers, arranged in the form of a
bower. This promiscuous exhibition of silk
gauze and various stuffs, intermingled with
embroidery in variegated silks, gold, and silver,
is most striking in effect, and forms, with
the bridal bower, a sight peculiarly Oriental
and gorgeous. The alcove is reserved for
the display of jewels and other precious objects
placed under glass shades.</p>

<p>When this adornment (which takes up
the whole night) is completed, the party goes
to the next room and arranges the furniture
sent for it, thence proceeding to the hall and
unpacking the bedding, which, placed against
the walls upon the empty cases, forms a
huge mass of colored strata of silk, embroidery,
and bright cotton print. One or two
little stools of walnut wood, inlaid with
mother-of-pearl, support the candelabra, and
the <i>hochaf</i> tray with its prettily cut crystal
bowl and ivory spoons would be placed in
front, together with the brooms, dustpan of
walnut wood inlaid with silver, both patterns
of the same materials, and the kitchen utensils,
<i>mangals</i>, and all other belongings of the
bride.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the bride is taken to the bath
with great ceremony, the expenses on this
occasion being defrayed by the bridegroom.
Before leaving the bath the bride is led three
times round the centre platform, kisses hands
all round, and goes out to be dressed. The
clothes she wears on this occasion must not
belong to her.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the bridegroom’s party of
lady friends go in a body to the home of the
bride, preceded by the <i>Koulavouz</i>, who announces
their arrival with an air of great importance.
Violent confusion ensues; the
mother, followed by her friends, descends
the staircase. They form a double row, each
couple conducting a visitor between them,
beginning with the bridegroom’s mother, and
proceed upstairs into apartments specially
reserved for the friends of the bridegroom,
who do not mix with the bride’s party on
this occasion. When their veils and cloaks
have been removed they seat themselves
round the room and partake of bitter coffee
and cigarettes, followed half an hour later by
sweet coffee. The bride is led into the room
by two hanoums who have only been married
once, and kisses the hands of all present,
beginning with her future mother-in-law,
and terminating with the youngest child in
the room. She is then seated on a chair near
her <i>Kayn Validé</i>, who is allowed on this occasion
to take her by her side for a few minutes
only, during which masticated sugar is
exchanged between them as a token of future
harmony. The bride is then taken away,
excused by some insipid remarks on the expiring
rights of maternal possession over her.</p>

<p>The dancing girls and musicians are now
called in and perform before the company,
receiving money from each person as they
leave the room in order to entertain the other
party of guests. When the bridegroom’s
friends are about to leave they throw small
coins over the head of the bride, who is led
down to the door for the purpose. The
scramble that ensues among the hawkers of
sweets, fruits, etc., assembled in the court,
the children, the beggars, and innumerable
parasites crowding houses during the celebration
of a wedding, is beyond description.</p>

<p>Before departure an invitation is given for
the evening to take part in the <i>Kena</i>, an entertainment
more especially designed for the
bride and her maiden friends. When the
company is assembled, tapers are handed to
each, and a procession formed, headed by
the bride, and accompanied by the dancing
girls and music. They descend the staircase
into the garden, and wind among the flower-beds
and groves of trees. The lights, the
gay dresses, flashing jewels, and floating hair
of the girls, the bright castanets, and the
wild songs and weird music of the accompanyists,
combine to form a glimpse of fairy-land,
or a dream of “The Thousand and
One Nights.”</p>

<p>The ceremony of the <i>Kena</i> consists in the
application of the henna mixture, which is
prepared towards morning. The bride, after
being divested of her wedding finery, enters
the presence of her mother-in-law, shading
her eyes with her left arm, while she seats
herself in the middle of the room. A silk
bath scarf is thrown over her outstretched
right hand, and is then thickly plastered over
with the henna, upon which her mother-in-law
sticks a gold coin, her example being
followed by the rest of her company. This
hand placed in a silk bag relieves the other in
covering her eyes, and the left hand is in its
turn extended and gifted in like manner by
the bride’s mother and <i>her</i> friends; the feet
are also stained with the henna. This is followed
by the last dance, called the <i>Sakusum</i>,
performed by the <i>Chingis</i>, accompanied by a
song and gestures of the most unrestrained
and immodest nature, terminating in these
dancers taking extraordinary positions before
each guest, sometimes even sitting on their
knees to receive their reward, which consists
of a small gold coin, damped in the mouth,
and deposited on their unblushing foreheads.
In these proceedings, the modesty and innocence
of the young girls present is never
thought about.</p>

<p>The bride reposes long enough for the
henna to impart its crimson dye, but not to
turn black, which would be considered a bad
augury.</p>

<p>The only touching scene in the whole
course of the wedding ceremonies, the girding
of the bride by her father, takes place in
the presence of her mother and sisters just
before she leaves the home of her childhood.
The father enters the room appearing deeply
affected, and sometimes even joining his
tears to the weeping of his wife and daughters.
The bride, also weeping, falls at his
feet, kisses them, and kisses his hands, while
he presses her to his breast and girds her
with the bridal girdle, giving at the same
time some good advice and his blessing.</p>

<p>In some district towns the bridegroom’s
male friends arrive at dawn with torches to
take away the bride. She is not, however,
seen by her husband until evening, when he
is taken to the mosque, and accompanied to
the door of his dwelling by the Imam. A
short prayer is offered, the company joining
in the refrain of <i>Amin, Amin</i>, at the conclusion
of which the happy man is pushed into
the house, a shower of blows falling on his
back; they then partake of sherbet standing,
and disperse. The bridegroom proceeding
upstairs comes upon a bowl of water,
which he upsets with his foot, scattering the
contents in all directions. The Koulavouz
meets and conducts him to the nuptial apartment,
where the bride, shy and trembling,
awaits the introduction of the complete stranger,
in whose hands her destiny for good or
for evil is now placed.</p>

<p>She rises as he enters and kisses his hand;
her bridal veil removed by the Koulavouz is
spread on the floor and knelt on by the
bridegroom, who offers a solemn prayer, the
bride all the time standing on its edge behind
him. The couple then sit side by side; the
old lady approaching their heads together
while she shows them the reflection of their
united images in a mirror, and expresses her
wishes for the continuation of their present
harmonious union.</p>

<p>Masticated sugar is exchanged between
them as a token of the sweetness that must
henceforth flow from their lips. Coffee follows,
after which the Koulavouz retires till
her services are again required for bringing
in the supper, which consists of sweets and
eggs, meat being excluded on the ground that
to indulge in it on so solemn an occasion
would lead to future bickerings between
them.</p>

<p>The supper hour depends upon the shyness,
obstinacy, or good-will of the bride, over
whom her husband can have no control until
he has succeeded in making her respond to
his questions. Brides are recommended by
experienced matrons to remain mute as long
as possible, and the husband is sometimes
obliged to resort to a stratagem in order to
accomplish this. The anxiously looked-for
speech is at once echoed by the relieved husband
by a knock on the wall, which is the
signal for supper. This partaken of, the
bride is divested of her finery and the paint
and flowers washed off by the Koulavouz,
and left to repose after the fatigue and excitement
of five successive days of festivity,
still to be extended for two days longer. On
the morrow she is again decked in her wedding
apparel to receive the crowd of hanoums,
invited and uninvited, that flock to the
house to gaze upon her.</p>

<p>I have said nothing about the bakhshish, or
presents, for the reason that the givers and
receivers are legion; nor of the kind of
amusement resorted to during these days,
since they consist principally in feasting,
drinking sherbet, smoking, and chatting, enlivened
only by the monotonous music and
the spectacle of dancing girls. This part
of the entertainment is so disgusting to behold,
and so repulsive to describe, that the
less I say about them the better; their immodesty
can only be matched by the obscene
conversations held by the numerous parasites
specially introduced for the amusement of
the company.</p>

<p>Entertainments of a similar nature take
place at the same time in the Selamliks of
both houses.</p>

<p>At Constantinople the bride is taken on the
Thursday morning from the paternal roof,
and conveyed in a carriage to her new home,
followed by a train of other carriages, preceded
by music and surrounded by buffoons,
performing absurd mummeries for the amusement
of the party, besides a numerous company
of unruly youths, some mounted and
others on foot, most of whom get intoxicated
and noisy on the occasion. The bride is received
by her husband at the door; he offers
his arm and conducts her upstairs through
the crowd of <i>hanoums</i>, who are not very
careful about hiding their faces, on the plea
that the bridegroom being otherwise occupied
will not look at them. He leads his
wife to the bower prepared for her, but before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
taking her seat a scuffle ensues between
them for precedence, each trying to step
upon the foot of the other, the successful
person being supposed to acquire the right of
future supremacy.</p>

<p>A Turkish wedding, as shown by this description,
in its frivolous forms and the absence
of the sanctity of a religious ordinance,
fails to impress one with the solemnity of
the Christian rite. The whole ceremony contains
many ridiculous superstitions and
much that is worse than absurd.</p>

<p>Polygamy was no invention of Mohammed’s:
he found it already firmly rooted in
Arabia. To abolish it was an idea that could
never have entered his mind. We must only
be grateful to him for having to some extent
set bounds to its evils. But those bounds are
thoroughly inadequate. Four wives and
perfect facility of divorce are bad enough,
without reckoning the permission to keep as
many concubines as a man pleases. But the
wretched necessities of polygamy and divorce
are wrapped up with the harem system. The
latter absolutely demands the former; and
though cases of true love do exist in Turkey
where a man resigns the so-called pleasures
of polygamy and of possessing odalisks; yet
it may be confidently asserted that until the
harem system, and with it polygamy, are
finally abolished, the condition of Mohammedan
women can never be anything but degraded.</p>

<p>Interested marriages are often contracted
by young Turks, to whom ambition or gratitude
recommends as partners some faded
court beauties called <i>Serailis</i>, or the ugly and
deformed daughter of the patron to whom
they owe their position and upon whom they
depend for future promotion. The number
of vizirs and pashas that have attained such
high rank solely through the interest and influence
of their wives is very great; a fact
which, if better known by Europeans, would
disabuse them of the idea that a Turkish wife
of every rank is the slave of her husband. I
have seen innumerable cases denoting the
reverse. The fraternity of meek, submissive,
and hen-pecked husbands is, I suppose,
like the gypsies, to be found all over the
world. Sultan Abdul-Medjid, on being informed
that his favorite wife had concealed
one of her lovers in a cupboard, had a scene
with her, during which he received a sound
box on the ear. At last the tyranny of this
much-loved beauty passed all endurance, and
the Sultan decided upon putting her away
and sending her into exile. His Grand Vizir
Reshid Pasha, was charged with the task of
visiting the Sultana and enforcing upon her
the Imperial order. She received him, heard
her fate unmoved, and, still confident in
the supreme power she possessed over her
lord and master, quietly collared his Grand
Vizir and walked him out of the room.</p>

<p>O⸺ Pasha, in his young days, contracted
a marriage of this kind with the
daughter of an influential minister. She was
humpbacked, with a face so distorted as to
render a disinterested marriage hopeless. I
made her acquaintance at Uskup, as she
passed through on her way to the interior of
Albania, where her husband had been appointed
Governor-General. She told me that
she had made a great sacrifice in leaving her
beautiful <i>Yahli</i> on the Bosphorus and undertaking
a journey the perils and hardships of
which were nearly killing her, but that she
thought it her duty to be near her husband
lest he, yielding to the temptation occasioned
by the absence of her surveillance, should
form new ties that might rob her of her
rights. “Do you Franks,” she asked,
“trust your husbands out of your sight?”</p>

<p>A week after her departure, another fussy
arrival of harems put Uskup into commotion.
On my inquiring whose they were, I was told
that they were the beautiful Circassian Odalisks
of O⸺ Pasha, who were following
the steps of his wife, entirely unknown to
her. On arriving at their destination I learnt
that they had been carefully smuggled by
their owner into a house which he visited
under the pretext of the long <i>teptil</i>, or night
watches, he had to make in the town in order
to see that all was right among his unruly
Arnaouts. It is true the story cuts two
ways: it not only shows that the husband
dared not be openly unfaithful to his wife,
but also that her suspicious surveillance was
entirely ineffectual.</p>

<p>Greek weddings vary in form and custom
according to the country in which they are
celebrated and to the degree of modification
ancient customs have experienced under the
influence of modern ideas. One of the most
interesting forms is that practised at Vodena
(Edessa, the ancient capital of Macedonia),
as comprising in its forms many of the customs
and usages of the ancient Greeks. The
preliminary ceremony is the ἀρραβών, or troth,
which, though it is not a religious rite, is
considered binding, and cannot lightly be set
aside. An incident that happened at Broussa
will show how strong is the bond of this
mere verbal engagement. A young Greek
girl, who had been talked about in the town,
was portioned by her influential protector,
and engaged to a young peasant who was
unacquainted with her and ignorant of her
antecedents and was induced to pledge his
word to marry her. All had been prepared
for the ceremony. The young man was hurried
to church, where he and his friends became
acquainted with the bride. Her appearance
did not satisfy the bridegroom, and
he refused to fulfil his promise. The officiating
priest insisted on the completion of the
ceremony, in right of the bridegroom’s
pledged word. A scuffle ensued, and the
active peasant, helped by his friends, effected
his escape from the church, leaving his
<i>fez</i> in the hands of one of his antagonists;
and, later on, obtained his release by legal
proceedings.</p>

<p>Contrary to European custom, the young
men are sought in marriage by the parents of
the girl, or through the intermediary, in imitation
of their ancestors, who employed such
persons in this service.</p>

<p>The usual age for the men is twenty-five,
and for the girls eighteen. The dowry is
settled in the presence of witnesses, who
bear testimony to the right of inheritance
of the children, and the <i>arravón</i> is considered
concluded when the bridegroom declares
himself satisfied with the amount of the promised
dowry. This belongs unconditionally
to the husband, except in case of divorce,
when it is returned, in accordance with a law
identical with that of the ancient Athenians.
The modern Greeks appear to attach as
much importance to the dowry as the ancient,
although it is no longer meant to denote
the difference between the γυνή and the
παλλακή, which was marked by the wife
bringing a dowry whilst the concubine
brought none.</p>

<p>The <i>trousseau</i> is being prepared long before
it is required by the careful parents, who by
degrees buy all the materials for it, the girl
herself having no other concern than to give
her help towards making up the various articles
of dress.</p>

<p>No Greek of the present day would refuse
to co-operate with his father in portioning
his sisters. He will renounce to himself the
privilege of taking a wife while any of his
sisters remain unmarried.</p>

<p>As soon as the engagement is made public,
the συνδεδεμένος, in company with his relatives
and friends, pays his respects to the
house of his future wife, who presents herself
in an extremely bashful attitude, her
eyes cast down, her hands crossed on her
breast, and her mien on the whole that of
one who tries to conceal pride and joy under
a stiff and conceited exterior.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Receiving
the felicitations of those present, she bows
three times, and then retires. Gilt βασιλικός
(basil) is offered as a memento of the event,
a relic of the ancients, who used herbs and
flowers in connection with the affairs of marriage.
As the company retire, the ἀρραβωνιαστική
(bride), standing at the head of the
staircase, kisses the hands of her future husband
and his friends, receiving in return gifts
of gold coins. This custom of kissing hands
on the part of the woman is a humiliating,
but in the East a common, mark of submission,
which our western ideas have happily
reversed.</p>

<p>It is customary for the bridegroom to send
occasional presents to the bride in the interval—of
varying length—between the betrothal
and the wedding. The document containing
the conditions of the ἀρραβών is delivered
to the bridegroom on the Sunday previous
to the wedding, and its receipt is acknowledged
by a present of bonbons, henna, hair-dye,
rouge, and soap, together with a double
flask containing wine.</p>

<p>On Monday, the bride and her maiden
friends collect, and, as in olden time, sift the
grain, which, on its return from the mill,
will be converted by them into bridal cakes.
Very bright are the faces and very merry the
voices of these young maidens thus busily
employed; the room resounds with their gay
laughter and joyous songs. On Wednesday
the gay company again assembles, increased
in number by friends and relatives, who arrive
in the evening to assist in kneading the
dough. The trough is brought in and filled
with a snowy pile of flour, which the Macedonian
maidens delight in converting into
savory cakes that none could disdain to partake
of; and, especially on this occasion,
they do their utmost to make them worthy
emblems of what their ancestors intended
them to represent. The trough is occupied
at one end by a saddle mounted by a boy
girded with a sword; on the other by a girl,
whose tiny hands must be the first to mix the
dough and lose in it the ring and coins.
These children must be bright and happy,
their lives unclouded by the death of even a
distant relation. This custom, having survived
the march of centuries, is left as an inheritance
to the Macedonians, pointing out
to the γαμβρός (bridegroom) the duties of the
husband, the care and defence of his home,—together
with his out-door labors,—while
it signifies to the Macedonian maiden that
she cannot begin too early to attend to her
household affairs. The kneading is continued
by more experienced hands, and the
dough left till the morrow, when it is divided
into portions and handed round to the company,
who all hopefully look for the hidden
ring, for which the lucky finder receives a
present when returning it to the bridegroom.
The paste, re-collected, is mixed with the
rest of the dough, from which the <i>propkasto</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
(wedding cake) and a variety of other cakes
are made. On Thursday the <i>propkasto</i> is
placed over a bowl of water, round which,
after the merry mid-day meal, the happy
youths and maidens dance three times, singing
a song suited to the occasion. The cake
is then taken up, broken in pieces, and, together
with figs and other fruits, thrown over
the heads of the couple; the children,
scrambling for these, are covered with a
blanket, another surviving custom of ancient
Greece, figs and cakes denoting plenty, rendered
doubly significant by the scrambling
children covered with the blanket, emblematic
of the future fruitfulness of the union
itself.</p>

<p>Friday is reserved for the interchange of
presents between the bride and bridegroom,
each awaiting with loving curiosity the expected
gift of the other; the right of the
first surprise belongs to the bride, whose beating
heart responds to the distant sounds of
music that herald the approach of the bearers,
who, on arrival, after having been thanked
and refreshed, are intrusted with the presents
destined by her for her betrothed.</p>

<p>On Saturday, invitations are issued, a formality
extended to the bride and bridegroom
who invite one another, enlivened, as regards
the <i>Koumbáros</i> and <i>Koumbára</i>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> with bands
of music, which, accompanying the invitation,
lead these distinguished visitors back to
partake of the festivities of the day.</p>

<p>In the evening the young girls for the last
time rally round their comrade, who, on the
next day, is to leave their ranks; and, amid
songs, tears, and vows of unalterable friendship,
the bride abandons her youthful locks,
dyed black, into the hands of her friends,
who dress it in a number of plaits in readiness
for the next day. The bridegroom on
his part, accompanied by his friends and
cheered by the sounds of lively music, submits
to the operation of shaving; during
which operation an ode to the razor is sung.</p>

<p>Sunday, looked upon as the most propitious
day, is fixed for the celebration of the
nuptials; relatives and friends collect at the
abode of the bridegroom, kiss the happy
man, offering him felicitations and presents,
and conduct him to the home of the bride,
preceded by the mother, who, on leaving the
house, empties a jar of water at the gate, and
places on the ground a belt, over which her
son steps. The procession stops on its way
to take the <i>koumbáros</i> and the <i>koumbára</i>.
On arriving at their destination, the formality
of exchanging the documents containing
the marriage contracts is gone through;
these are presented by the priest to the respective
parties, the dowry in cash is delivered
and sent to the bridegroom’s home.
The second ἀρραβών then takes place in the
following manner, and in accordance with
the customs of the ancient Greeks. The
bride’s father, or nearest of kin, presents
himself to the father, or nearest of kin, of the
bridegroom, and offers him in a plate some
basil, saying, “Accept the engagement of
my daughter to your son,” repeating his request
three times; this ceremony is repeated
on the bridegroom’s side, and followed by
the presentation of a glass of wine, a ring-shaped
cake, and a spoon to the bridegroom,
who partakes of the wine, and drops money
into the glass, in acknowledgment to the
bride of this attention; he keeps half the
cake, giving the other half and the spoon
into the charge of the best man, who feeds
the bride with it next morning. This messenger
is followed by another, who comes to
gird the bridegroom, lifting him up at the
same time, which latter task is made as difficult
as possible by the person operated upon,
in order to gain more consideration. More
kisses are now showered upon him by the
relatives of the bride, after which he is left in
peace for a time; while the bride, in another
room, has her own trials to go through, those
trials of the heart which belong to the supreme
moment when the maiden is about to
tear herself away from the thousand dear
associations of home, to bid farewell to
mother and brother and sister, and then to
enter upon new duties, new ties and affections.</p>

<p>Like all things, this soon comes to an end;
it is the best man’s duty to conclude it, in a
strictly unsentimental manner, by putting
on the bride’s boots, a gift from her future
husband. The bride, veiled, is led to the
church, followed by the rest of the company;
bonbons are thrown over her head and
water spilt, this time by her mother, on her
march as she passes the gate. The clear
rhythm of a triumphal march, accompanied
by a bridal chorus, rules the slow steps of
the procession. At length it reaches the
church; but before entering it, the bridegroom’s
mother asks the maiden three times,
“Bride, hast thou the shoes?” The couple
then enter the church, holding richly-decorated
tapers, and proceed to the altar, where
they stand side by side, the bride on the left
of the bridegroom. The priest, after reading
part of the ritual, makes the sign of the cross
three times with the rings over the heads of
their respective owners, and places them on
their hands, saying, Ἀρραβωνίζετε ὁ δοῦλος τοῦ
θεοῦ (giving the name of the man), τὴν δούλην
τοῦ θεοῦ (the name of the woman), in the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three
times; leaving to the <i>koumbáros</i> the duty of
exchanging them. This terminates the third
ἀρραβών, and the marriage service begins by
the priest taking the wedding wreaths, placing
them on the heads of the bride and the
bridegroom, saying, Στέφετε ὁ δοῦλος τοῦ θεοὑ
(giving the name of the bridegroom), τὴν
δούλην τοῦ θεοῦ (the name of the woman), in
the name of the Father, etc., exchanging
them three times. A glass of wine, consecrated
by the priest, is offered first to the
bridegroom, then to the bride, and finally to
the <i>koumbáros</i> standing behind the couple
holding the wreaths. The priest then joins
their hands, and leads them three times round
the altar; the <i>koumbáros</i> follows. The priest
then removes the bridegroom’s crown, saying,
Μεγαλύνθητι Νυμφίε ὡς ὁ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ εὐλογήθητι
ὡς ὁ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ πληθύνθητι ὡς ὁ Ἰακώβ,
and that of the bride, saying, Καὶ σὺ, νύμφη,
μεγλιζε ὡς ἡ Σαῤῥὰ καὶ εὐφράνθητι ὠς ἡ Ῥεβεχὰ,
κ. τ. λ.</p>

<p>The ceremony concluded, the <i>koumbáros</i>
followed by the relations, kisses the bride
and bridegroom, while the friends in offering
their congratulations kiss the bridegroom and
the wreath of the bride. On returning, the
bride’s mother welcomes the couple by placing
two loaves on their heads, while a fresh
shower of comfits is being thrown over
them. They are finally conducted to the
nuptial chamber, and not spared the ordeal
of sweetmeat-eating. The quince of the ancients
is replaced by sugar-plums.</p>

<p>The manner in which this is given and
taken is curious. The couple bend on one
knee, placing a few sugar-plums on the other,
which each strives to pick up with the lips,
the most expeditious having the right first to
resume liberty of posture. I have not been
able to ascertain if this particular custom is
meant to predict supreme power to the lord
and master in case of success, or his subjection
to petticoat government in case of failure.</p>

<p>Towards evening, the bride, led by her
father-in-law, or husband’s nearest of kin,
proceeds to the common outside the town or
village, and opens a round dance, called the
<i>surto</i>. This dance consists of a quick step,
accompanied by music and chanting; after
its performance the company disperse, the
nearest relations leading the couple home.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the sleepers are wakened
by songs, and the <i>koumbáros</i>, invited to
partake of the frugal morning meal, feeds
the bride with the remaining half of the cake,
and offers her the spoon with which she eats
the first mouthful of food that day.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the bride is the first to
leave the table, and goes to the well accompanied
by her friends, round which she
walks three times, dropping an <i>obol</i> into it
from her lips, a sacred attention of the ancients
to the water deities, and still in vogue
among the moderns. On returning home,
the bride, desirous of making her husband
share in the benefits of her dedication, pours
some water over his hands, offering at the
same time the towel on which to dry them,
and receiving in return a present from him.</p>

<p>The rejoicings continue throughout the
day, the bride’s father, or nearest of kin,
having this time the right of opening the
dance with her.</p>

<p>On the following Friday evening, the
young matron proudly returns in company
with her husband, to the paternal roof, under
which they remain till Saturday night.</p>

<p>Five days afterwards the bride again returns
to visit her mother, taking with her a
bottle of <i>raki</i>, which she exchanges, taking
a fresh supply back with her. The Saturday
following, a great feast is given by the bride’s
father, inviting all the relatives to a cordial
but sober meal. In the evening the bride is
accompanied home by the party, when she is
left in peace to enter upon the duties of her
new home.</p>

<p>The modern Greeks fully deserve the praise
they receive for the virtues that distinguish
their family life, the harmony of which is
seldom disturbed by the troubles and dissensions
caused by illegal connections, acts of
cruelty, or other disorders. Incompatibility
of feeling in unhappy unions is wisely settled
by separation. In more serious cases a divorce
is appealed for to the bishop of the diocese,
who submits it to the council of the <i>demogerontia</i>,
which, according to the merits
of the case, gives a decision, or refers it to
the Patriarch at Constantinople. Thus the
scandal of an open court of law is avoided,
and the offspring, innocent of all participation
in the crime (should there be any) are
not made to suffer from its unjust stigma.</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE AMONG THE BULGARIANS.</h3>

<p>Fourteen years spent among Bulgarians
afforded me the opportunity of witnessing
many marriage ceremonies, which were very
peculiar and interesting. Especially curious
are those of Upper Macedonia, as presenting
remarkable traces of Dionysian worship.</p>

<p>The matrimonial negotiations are carried
on by the <i>stroinichitsita</i> and <i>stroinitcote</i>, persons
commissioned by the parents to find a
suitable <i>parti</i> for their marriageable daughters;
the proposal, among the peasants, being
addressed by the man to the parents of the
girl, who accept it on the promise of a sum
of money, ranging from £50 to £300, according
to his means. The sum is offered
as purchase-money for the labor of the hardy
maiden, whose substantial assistance in field
and other work to the <i>paterfamilias</i> ceases on
the marriage day, when her services pass to
her husband.</p>

<p>Wednesday or Thursday evenings are considered
most propitious for the betrothal,
which takes place in the presence of witnesses,
and consists in the exchange of marriage
contracts, certifying on one side the
promised sum of money, and on the other
stating the quantity and quality of the <i>trousseau</i>
the bride will bring. The interchange
of contracts is followed by that of rings between
the affianced, offered to them by the
priest who asks each person if the proposal
of the other is accepted. A short blessing
follows, and this simple betrothal is concluded
by the bride kissing the hands of her
affianced husband and of the rest of the company.</p>

<p>These engagements, never known to be
broken, are often prolonged for years by selfish
parents, who are unwilling to part with
the services of a daughter who is valued as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
an efficient laborer. This unjust delay gives
rise to clandestine associations, tolerated, but
not acknowledged, by the parents, and finally
ending in matrimony. Runaway marriages
are also of frequent occurrence in cases when
there is difficulty about the payment of the
portion. The young couple elope on an appointed
day, and ride to the nearest church,
where they are at once united. On returning
home the bride usually hides herself in
the house of some relative, until friends intervening
obtain her father’s forgiveness.</p>

<p>The principles of good faith and honor are
sacredly kept among these simple people,
who are never known to break their pledged
word under any circumstances.</p>

<p>How curious would an English girl think
the preliminary customs that a virgin in this
fine, but now neglected, country must observe
before entering upon the state of holy
matrimony. And yet, rude and primitive as
these customs are, they well deserve our attention
as having once belonged, in part at
least, to a wonderful civilization, now lost,
but never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Preparing the house for the coming festivity,
washing with ceremony the bride’s
head, exhibiting the <i>trousseau</i> for the inspection
of the matrons, who do not spare their
criticism on its merits or demerits, while the
young and thoughtless are busy putting a
last stitch here and there amid gay songs and
cheerful talk; the ornamentation of cakes
sent round to friends and relatives in lieu of
invitation cards,—all these are old customs
which ring in unison with the peaceful and
industrious habits of a people whose life in
happier times reminded one of the Arcadias
of the poets.</p>

<p>Nor is the marriage ceremony itself void
of interest. I was present at one of these
while staying at a large Bulgarian settlement
in Upper Macedonia. The village, buried in
a picturesque glen, looked bright and cheery.
Its pretty white church and neat school-house
stood in the midst; around were the
farm-houses and cottages, roofed with stone
slabs, standing in large farmyards, where the
golden hay and corn-stacks, the green trees,
and small flower-beds disputed the ground
with a roving company of children, pigs, and
fowls.</p>

<p>The wedding took place in the house of a
rich Chorbadji, who was giving his daughter
in marriage to a young Bulgarian from a
village on the opposite side of the glen. The
festivities began on a Monday and lasted
through the week, each day bringing its duties
and pleasures, its songs, music, and dancing,—indispensable
parts of a Bulgarian peasant’s
existence.</p>

<p>On the eve of the wedding-day the virgin
meal took place, each maiden arriving with
her offering of sweets in her hands. It was
a pretty sight to look at all those bright
young faces, for the time free from care and
lighted up with smiles of content and joy.
It takes so little to amuse innocent peasant
girls, for whom a day of rest is a boon in itself,
well appreciated and generally turned
to good account.</p>

<p>On Sunday, in the early forenoon, the company
once more assembled. The children,
washed and dressed, played about the yard,
filling the air with their joyous voices. The
matrons led their daughters in their bright
costumes, covered with silver ornaments,
their heads and waists garlanded with flowers.
The young men also, decked out in
their best, and equally decorated with flowers,
stood to see them pass by, and to exchange
significant smiles and looks.</p>

<p>On entering the house, I was politely
offered a seat in the room where the bride, in
her wedding dress, a tight mantelet closely
studded with silver coins, and hung about
with strings of coins intertwined with flowers,
sat awaiting the arrival of the bridegroom’s
company, who were to lead her to
her new home. The sound of distant music
soon announced their approach, and was the
signal for the touching scene of <i>adieux</i>. All
the bride’s smiles died away, and tears stood
in every eye. Kissing hands all round, and
being kissed in return, she was led by her
father to the gate, and mounted upon a horse
that awaited her; the rest of the company
followed her, all mounted also. The scene
changed, and as we rode along the mountain
paths I felt myself transported into the
mythological age in the midst of a company of
Thyiades, garlanded with flowers and vine-leaves,
proceeding to the celebration of their
festival. The procession, headed by a standard-bearer
carrying a banner surmounted
by an apple, and followed by a band of
music, wended its way along the mountain
paths. The wild strains of the minstrels
were echoed by the shouts and songs of the
company, excitedly careering among the
flowery intricacies of the mountain passes,
like a wild chorus of Bacchantes. On entering
the village, the procession was completed
by the addition of the <i>Nunco</i> (best man) with
the <i>Stardever</i>, who, like the Kanephoroi in
the Dionysia, carried baskets of fruit, cakes,
the bridal crowns, and the flasks of wine, and
led the sacrificial goat with its gilded horns,
all gifts of the <i>Nunco</i>.</p>

<p>On arriving at the gate of the bridegroom’s
house, the standard-bearer marched in and
planted his banner in the middle of the court.
The bride, following, stayed her horse before
it, and, after a verse had been sung by the
company,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> she bowed three times, and was
assisted to dismount by her father-in-law.
On parting with her horse she kissed his
head three times, and then, holding one end
of a handkerchief extended to her by her
father-in-law, was led into a kind of huge
cellar, dimly lighted by the few rays that
found their way through narrow slits high
up in the walls. In the midst stood a wine-barrel
crowned with the bridal cake, on
which was placed a glass of wine. The
scene here deepened in interest; the priests,
in their gorgeous sacerdotal robes and high
black hats, holding crosses in their hands,
stood over this Bacchanalian altar awaiting
the bride and bridegroom, who, garlanded
with vine-leaves and also holding tapers, advanced
solemnly, when the sacred Christian
marriage rite, thus imbued with the mysteries
of the Dionysian festivals, was performed.
After having tasted the wine contained in the
glass, and while walking hand-in-hand three
times round the barrel, a shower of fruits,
cakes, and sugar-plums was thrown over the
couple. The ceremony ended by the customary
kissing, as observed among the Greeks.
The company then sat down to a hearty
meal. The feasting on such occasions lasts
till morning; dancing, drinking, and singing
continue till dawn, without, however, any
excess.</p>

<p>The next day, the banner crowned with
the apple, still keeping its place, proclaims to
the guests who come to lead the bride to the
village well to throw in her <i>obol</i>, that she has
virtuously acquired the rights of a wife.
Should the reverse be the case, the bride receives
severe corporal punishment, and
mounted on a donkey, with her face turned
towards its tail, which she holds in her
hands, is led back to her father’s house—a
barbarous custom which must be set aside
after the disorders lately committed in this
country.</p>

<p>The custom of marrying in the most retired
part of the house, instead of the church,
among the peasants, is, according to my information,
the result of the dread they had
in times of oppression of giving unnecessary
publicity to their gatherings, and thus inviting
the cupidity of some savage band of
their oppressors, who scrupled not when
they had a chance to fall upon and rob
and injure them. This state of things was
brought back during late events.</p>

<p>Some months ago, a marriage was taking
place in the village of B⸺, in Macedonia.
The bridal procession had just returned
from church, when a band of ferocious
Turks fell upon the house where the festivities
were being held, robbing and beating
right and left, until they arrived at the unfortunate
bride, whom, after divesting of
all her belongings, they dishonored and left
to bewail her misfortunes in never-ending
misery. The distracted husband, barely
escaping with his life, rushed into the street,
loudly calling upon his Christian brethren to
shoot him down, and thus relieve him of the
life whose burden he could not bear.</p>

<p>The <i>trousseau</i> of a Bulgarian peasant girl
consists of the following articles: A long
shirt, embroidered with fine tapestry work in
worsted or colored silks round the collar,
sleeves, and skirt; a sleeveless coat (<i>sutna</i>),
tightly fitting the figure, made of home-spun
woollen tissue, also richly embroidered; a sash
(<i>poyous</i>), made of plaited wool, half an inch
wide and about eighty yards long, with which
they gird themselves; an overcoat, also embroidered;
an apron, completely covered with
embroidery; embroidered woollen socks, garters,
and red shoes. The head-dress varies
according to the district. In Bulgaria proper
a sort of high coif is worn, not unlike the
pointed cap of English ladies in the Middle
Ages. In Macedonia, to the hair, cut short
upon the forehead and plaited behind in a
number of braids, is added a long fringe of
black wool, braided, fastened round the head
and falling below the knees; the crown of
the head being covered with a richly embroidered
white cloth, fastened on with innumerable
silver ornaments and strings of
coins. The whole wardrobe, made of strong,
durable materials, is home-spun and home-made,
and being elaborately embroidered
forms an <i>ensemble</i> extremely picturesque,
very durable, and well adapted to the mode
of life of the wearers. One of these dresses
often requires three months’ constant work
to accomplish its embroidery; but I may as
well add that it will take a lifetime to wear
it out.</p>

<p>In addition to these articles of dress, whose
number varies according to the condition of
the person for whom they are intended, carpets,
rugs, towels, and a few sheets are
added, together with a number of silver ornaments,
such as belts, necklaces, earrings, and
bracelets, some of which are extremely pretty.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian <i>trousseaux</i>, needing so much
time and work, are in course of preparation
while the children for whom they are intended
are still in their infancy, and as each article
is woven, it is packed away in a long,
bolster-shaped bag, in unison with their careful
custom of exposing their belongings to
observation as little as possible.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell long upon the marriage
of the wealthy in large towns like Philippopolis.
The religious service used is that of
the orthodox Greek Church, since there is no
doctrinal difference between the creeds of the
Greeks and the Bulgarians.</p>

<p>The festivities, both among rich and poor,
are continued for a week; the former still
adhering to some of the old usages for form’s
sake. In the town of Philippopolis the native
customs have been in part set aside and
replaced by the European. At the last marriage
I witnessed there the bride was a shy
little beauty, well versed in her own language,
with a pretty good knowledge of
modern Greek and a smattering of French.
Her <i>trousseau</i>, like those of many of her
rank, had been received from Vienna, as well
as the bridal dress, veil, and wreaths, presents
from the bridegroom. Some years ago
dowries were not demanded, but a good
amount of fine jewelry, much appreciated
by Bulgarian ladies, formed an indispensable
appendage to the <i>trousseau</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the European apparel given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
brides, a large amount of native home-made
articles of dress and house linen are added.
Some of these are of exquisite taste and
workmanship, such as <i>crêpe</i> chemises, made
of mixed raw and floss silk; embroidered
towels and sheets, worked with an art and
taste that can well vie with the finest French
and English embroideries; besides tissues in
home-woven silk and cotton for bedding, and
other articles of native manufacture that
would be well appreciated if they could find
their way into the wardrobes of fashionable
Europeans.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian <i>élite</i> follow the custom of
being asked in marriage on the lady’s side.</p>

<p>A number of Bulgarians are now educated
in foreign countries, and attain distinction
and great success in the professions they
exercise. When a sufficient competence for
life has been acquired, they return to their
homes in order to marry on their native soil,
to which they are devotedly attached.</p>

<p>Great is the commotion that the return of
one of these absentees occasions. Each
member of the tribe of <i>Stroinicotes</i>, busily
working in the interest he or she represents,
tries to outdo the others, until the coveted
prize is obtained. In the mean time the newcomer
is feasted in every direction, the mothers
doing their utmost to be amiable and the
daughters to look their best; while the fathers
are calculating whether the new custom
of giving dowries to their daughters is likely
to be one of the conditions of the hopeful
match. Great is the glee of a parent on
hearing the welcome words of <i>Né kem pari;
sa kumchupa</i> (I ask no money; I want the
maiden), upon which the match is soon concluded
by the usual routine of betrothal,
exchange of contracts, and presents. The
lover is free to visit his <i>fiancée</i>, and instill into
her mind the ideas and feelings that must
elevate her to his own standard; a praiseworthy
duty, often crowned with success
when the husband undertakes it in earnest.
Some of my most esteemed friends in Bulgaria
were the wives of highly educated men.
The knowledge they possessed was limited;
but they were gentle, virtuous, ladylike, and
admirable housewives, devoting all their
efforts to the education and improvement of
their children, in whom they try to develop
those talents and qualities that in their own
youth had been left untrained. The Bulgarians
after marriage are attached to their
home, husband and wife uniting their efforts
to make it comfortable and happy.</p>

<h3>ARMENIAN WEDDINGS.</h3>

<p>The Armenian <i>fiançailles</i>, although contracted
in a very simple fashion, are not
easily annulled, and can only be set aside for
very serious reasons.</p>

<p>A priest, commissioned by the friends of
the aspirant, makes the proposals of marriage
to the young lady’s parents. Should the
offer be accepted, he is again sent, accompanied
by another priest, to present to the
<i>fiancée</i> a small gold cross bought by her betrothed
for the benefit of the Church, and of
a price proportioned to the means of the
family.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Girls are given in marriage at a very early
age, some when they are but twelve years
old; but men seldom marry before they are
twenty-two.</p>

<p>The wedding ceremony, as I remember
seeing it in my childhood, and as it still takes
place in Armenia, where customs <i>à la Franca</i>
have not yet penetrated among the primitive,
semi-civilized people, is a truly curious proceeding.
Like the Turkish wedding, it takes
place on a Monday. A priest is sent by the
bride’s parents to inform those of the bridegroom
that all is ready and the <i>Duhun</i> may
begin. On the Friday, invitations are issued
and the bride is taken to the bath with great
ceremony. On the Saturday, musicians are
called in, and all the young maidens assemble
to partake of a feast intended especially for
them, and extended to the poor, who come
in flocks to share in the good things.</p>

<p>Next day this festivity is repeated; the
dinner is served at three, and the young men
are allowed to wait upon the girls—a rare
privilege, equally pleasing to either sex, at
other times excluded from each other’s society—and
it is needless to say that they now
make the most of their opportunities.</p>

<p>As soon as this repast is over, the married
people sit down to the wedding dinner in a
patriarchal fashion, husband and wife side
by side, while the young men are the last to
partake of the bridal repast. In the evening,
they are again admitted to the company
of the ladies, on the plea of handing refreshments
to them. About ten o’clock the bride
is taken into another room by her friends,
who place upon her head a curious silver
plate, over which a long piece of scarlet silk
is thrown, falling to her feet, secured at the
sides by ribbons, enveloping her in a complete
bag, drawn tight at the top of her head,
under the silver plate; two extraordinary-looking
wings called <i>sorgooch</i>, made of stiff
card-board, covered with feathers, are fastened
on each side of the head. When this
disguise is complete, the bride, blindfolded
by her veil, is led forth from the apartment,
and conducted by her father or nearest male
relative to open a round dance, during the
performance of which money is showered
over her. She is then led to a corner, where
she sits awaiting the arrival of the bridegroom
in the solitude of her crimson cage.</p>

<p>The bridegroom’s toilette begins early in
the afternoon: he is seated in the middle of
the room surrounded by a joyous company
of friends; the <i>gingahar</i>, or best man, and a
host of boys arrive, accompanied by the band
of music sent in search of them.</p>

<p>The barber, an all-important functionary,
must not be overlooked: razor in hand, girded
with his silk scarf, his towel over one
shoulder, and a species of leather strap over
the other, he commences operations, prolonged
during an indefinite period, much enlivened
by his gossip and <i>bon mots</i>, and turned
to his advantage by the presents he receives
from the assembled company, who, one by
one, suspend their gifts on a cord, stretched
by him for the purpose across the room.
These gifts consist chiefly of towels, pieces
of cloth, scarves, etc. When the gossip considers
the generosity of the company exhausted,
he gives the signal for the production
of the wedding garments, which, brought
in state together with the bridegroom’s presents
to his bride, must receive the benediction
of the priest before they can be used.</p>

<p>After the evening meal has been partaken
of, the gifts, accompanied by the musicians,
are conveyed to the bride, the company following
with the bridegroom, who walks between
two torches, and is met at the door by
another band of music.</p>

<p>On entering the presence of his future
mother-in-law and her nearest relatives, he
receives a gift from her and respectfully
kisses her hand. Allowed a few moments’
rest, he is seated on a chair between two flaring
torches, after which he is led into the
presence of his veiled bride, to whom he extends
his hand, which she takes, extricating
her own with difficulty from under her <i>duvak</i>,
and is assisted to descend from her sofa corner,
and stands facing her betrothed with
her forehead reclining against his. A short
prayer, called the “half service,” is read
over the couple; their hands, locked together,
must not be loosed till they arrive at the
street door, when two bridesmaids supporting
the bride on each side lead her at a slow
pace to the church.</p>

<p>The procession is headed by the bridegroom
and his men, followed by the bride
and the ladies; no person is allowed to cross
the road between the two parties. On entering
the sacred edifice, the couple, making the
sign of the cross three times, offer a prayer,
believing that whatever they ask at this moment
will be granted them; they then approach
the altar steps and stand side by side.
An Armenian superstition considers some
days more propitious than others for the celebration
of weddings, consequently a number
of bridal couples generally collect on the
same day, and at the same hour. I was
present on one occasion when the church at
Broussa, although a vast building, scarcely
sufficed to accommodate the friends of the
sixty couples waiting to get married. The
brides, all similarly dressed, were pushed forward
by the dense crowd of relatives, friends,
and spectators towards the altar, where the
sixty bridegrooms awaited them, standing in
a line. Two brides, alike in stature, changed
places, in the hurry and confusion of the
moment. One was a pretty peasant girl,
whose only dower was her beauty, destined
to become the wife of a blacksmith; the
other was the ugly daughter of a wealthy
Armenian, about to be united to a man of
her own station. The mistake was noticed,
but the nuptial knot being already tied, it
was too late to be rectified, no divorce for such
a cause being allowed among Armenians.</p>

<p>The bridegroom who could only complain
in a pecuniary point of view made the best
of it,—doubtless consoled by the adage that
beauty unadorned is adorned the most; while
the blacksmith, greatly benefited by this unexpected
good turn from Dame Fortune, had
probably pleasant dreams of abandoning the
hammer and anvil and passing the rest of his
days in ease, affluence, and plenty, and was
ready to admit that riches, like fine garments,
may hide a multitude of defects.</p>

<p>But let us return to the marriage ceremony.
The first part of the service is read by
the priest, standing on the altar steps; the
couples, placed in a row before him, with
the best men and boys behind him. He asks
each couple separately, first the bridegroom,
and then the bride, the following question:—“<i>Chiorus
topalus cabullus?</i>”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> To which
the parties answer in the affirmative. Should
either person object to the union, the objection
is accepted, and the marriage cannot be
proceeded with; but incidents of this kind
are rare: only one ever came under my notice.</p>

<p>After the formalities of the acceptance
have been gone through, the couple stand
facing each other, with their heads touching,
and a small gold cross is tied with a red silken
string on the forehead of each, and the
symbol of the Holy Ghost pressed against
them. The ceremony terminates by the partaking
of wine; after which, the married
pair walk hand-in-hand to the door of the
church; but from the church to her home
the bride is once more supported by the
bridesmaids. The moment they are about to
cross the threshold, a sheep is sacrificed, over
whose blood they step into the house.</p>

<p>When husband and wife are seated side by
side, the guests come one by one, kiss the
crosses on their foreheads, and drop coins
into a tray, for the benefit of the officiating
priest.</p>

<p>The bride is now once more led to her solitary
corner; the veil, which she has been
wearing all the time of the ceremony, is momentarily
lifted from her face, and she is refreshed
with a cup of coffee, into which she
drops money as she gives it back; a male
child is then placed on her knees for a short
time. This formality is followed by a regular
scramble for her stockings by a flock of
children, who make a great rush towards her
feet, pull off her boots and stockings, which
they shake, in order to find the money previously
placed in them.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom soon after open
a round dance, and during its performance
money is again thrown over their heads.</p>

<p>The bride is again led back to her corner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
where she remains a mute and veiled image;
sleeping at night with that awful plate on her
head, and guarded by her maiden friends,
who do not desert her until Wednesday evening,
when the bridegroom is finally allowed
to dine <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the bride. The only
guests admitted that day to the family dinner
are the priest and his wife; the latter
passes the night in the house, and is commissioned
the next morning to carry the tidings
to the bride’s mother that her daughter has
happily entered upon the duties of married
life.</p>

<p>At noon a luncheon is given to the relatives
and friends, who collect to offer their
congratulations.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the ceremony of kissing the
hands of her mother and father-in-law is
again gone through; the bridal veil on this
occasion is replaced by one of crimson <i>crêpe</i>,
which she wears until her father-in-law gives
her a present and allows her to remove it.
Brides are not allowed to utter a word in the
presence of a near relative of their husband
until permitted to do so by his father. This
permission, however, is sometimes not easily
obtained, and years may elapse before it is
given. Many a young wife has gone to her
grave without having spoken to her father-
and mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Though the Armenians are sensual and
despotic, they generally make good husbands;
but the standard of morality is getting
lax among the emancipated followers of
the customs <i>à la Franca</i>, who, being entirely
ignorant of the rules of true breeding, often
abuse the freedom of European manners.</p>

</div>

<p>Few people in the world view the approach
of death with such indifference, or
receive its fatal blow with such calmness and
resignation, as the Moslems.</p>

<p>According to some verses taken from the
Koran, earthly existence is but a fleeting
shadow, seen for a moment, then lost sight
of forever; its joys and pleasures all delusion;
itself a mere stepping-stone to the
celestial life awaiting the true believer.</p>

<p>“Know that this life is but a sport—a
pastime—a show—a cause of vain-glory
among you! And the multiplying of riches
and children is like the (plants which spring
up after) rain; whose growth rejoices the
husbandman; then they wither away and
thou seest them all yellow; then they become
stubble.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Kismet (destiny) and Edjel (the appointed
time of death) are decreed by Allah. Every
one of his creatures has these traced on his
forehead in invisible letters. Kismet, disposing
of his earthly career; Edjel, fixing its
duration and the nature of its end. “To an
appointed time doth he respite them.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Seen from this fatalistic point of view, the
terrors of death impress Moslems mostly
when viewed from a distance; and its name,
softened by some poetical expression, is never
uttered in refined society without the preface
of <i>Sis den irak olsoun</i>, “Far be it from you;”
and the common people invariably spit before
uttering it.</p>

<p>At the approach of death, the moribund
appears resigned to his fate, and his friends
reconciled to the thought of his approaching
end. No Imam or servant of God is called
in to soothe the departing spirit or speed its
flight by the administration of sacraments.
The friends and relatives collected round the
couch weep in silence, and if the departing
one is able to speak, <i>helal</i> (forgiveness) is requested
and given. Prayers are repeated by
the pious, to keep away the evil spirits that
are supposed to collect in greater force at
such moments. Charitable donations are
made, and other acts of generosity performed
at death-beds; and frequently at such times
slaves are set free by their owners; for it is
written: “They who give alms by night and
by day, in private and in public, shall have
their reward with their Lord; no fear shall
come upon them, neither shall they grieve.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The moment the soul is believed to have
quitted the body, the women begin to utter
wailings. Some tear their hair, others beat
their breasts, in an outburst of genuine sorrow.
A lull soon follows, and, without loss
of time, preparations are made for performing
the last duties to the corpse; for the Turks
do not keep their dead unburied any longer
than is necessary for the completion of these
preliminaries.</p>

<p>If the death be that of a person of consequence,
the Muëzzin chants the special cry
from the minaret; and invitations are issued
to friends and acquaintances for the funeral.
Directly after death the eyelids are pressed
down and the chin bandaged; the body is undressed
and laid on a bed called <i>rahat yatak</i>
(“couch of comfort”) with the hands
stretched by the side, the feet tied together,
and the head turned towards the <i>Kibla</i>. A
veil is then laid over the body. While the
company is gathering in the Selamlik, or in
the street, performing the ablution (<i>abtest</i>),
and preparing for the prayer (<i>namaz</i>), the
corpse, if it be that of a man, is taken into
the court-yard on the stretcher, and an Imam,
with two subordinates, proceeds to wash it.</p>

<p>The formalities connected with this observance
are of strictly religious character, and
consequently carried out to the letter. The
first condition to be observed is to keep the
lower part of the body covered, the next to
handle it with great gentleness and attention,
lest those engaged in the performance of that
duty draw upon them the curse of the dead.
Seven small portions of cotton are rolled up
in seven small pieces of calico; each of these
is successively passed between the limbs by
the Imam, while some hot water is poured
over the bundles, which are then cast away
one after the other. After the rest of the
body has been washed, the <i>abtest</i>, or formal
religious ablution, is administered to it. This
consists in washing the hands, and in bringing
water in the hand three times to the nose,
three times to the lips, and three times from
the crown of the head to the temples; from
behind the ears to the neck; from the palm
of the hand to the elbow, and then to the
feet, first to the right and then to the left.
This strange ceremony is performed twice.
The <i>tabout</i> (coffin) is then brought in and
placed by the side of the stretcher, both of
coarse deal, put together with the rudest
workmanship. Before laying the body in the
coffin, a piece of new calico, double its size,
is brought. A strip about two inches in
width is torn off the edge, and divided into
three pieces, which are placed upon three
long scarves laid across the shell. The calico,
serving as a shroud, is next stretched in
the coffin, and a thousand and one drachms
of cotton, with which to envelope the corpse,
are placed upon it. Some of this cotton is
used to stop the issues of the body, and is
placed under the armpits and between the
fingers and toes.</p>

<p>The body is then dressed in a sleeveless
shirt, called <i>kaflet</i>, and is gently placed in
the coffin. Pepper is sifted on the eyes, and
a saline powder on the face, to preserve from
untimely decay; rose-water is then sprinkled
on the face, which is finally enveloped in the
remainder of the cotton. The shroud is then
drawn over and secured by the three strips of
calico, one tied round the head, the other
round the waist and the third round the feet,
and the coffin is closed down.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the guests are admitted;
and the Imam, turning round, asks the
crowd: “O congregation! What do you
consider the life of this man to have been?”
“Good,” is the invariable response. “Then
give <i>helal</i> to him.”</p>

<p>The coffin, covered with shawls and carrying
at the head the turban or fez of the
deceased hung on a peg, is then borne on the
shoulders of four or more individuals who
are constantly relieved by others; and the
funeral procession, composed exclusively of
men, headed by the Imam and Hodjas, slowly
winds its way in silence through the
streets until it arrives at the mosque where
the funeral service is to be read. The coffin
is deposited on a slab of marble, and a short
Namaz, called <i>Mihit Namaz</i>, is performed by
the congregation standing. This concluded,
the procession resumes its way to the burial-ground,
where the coffin is deposited by the
side of the grave, which, for a man, is dug
up to the height of a man’s waist, for a woman,
up to her shoulder.</p>

<p>A small clod of earth, left at one end of the
excavation, in the direction of the <i>Kibla</i>,
takes the place of a pillow. The coffin is then
uncovered, and the body gently lifted out of it
by the ends of the three scarves, previously
placed under it (one supporting the head,
another the middle of the body, and the third
the feet), and lowered into its last resting-place.
A short prayer is then recited, a
plank or two laid at a little distance above
the body, and the grave is filled up.</p>

<p>At this stage, all the congregation withdraw,
and the Imam is left alone by the side
of the grave, where he is believed to enter
into mysterious communications with the
spirit of the departed, who is supposed to
answer all the questions on his creed which
his priest puts to him. He is prompted in
these answers by two spirits, one good and
one evil, who are believed to take their places
by his side. Should he have been an indifferent
follower of the Prophet, and forbidden
to enter Paradise, the evil spirit forces
him to deny the only true God, and make a
profession unto himself. A terrible battle is
supposed to ensue in the darkness of the
grave between the good and evil spirits called
<i>Vanqueur</i> and <i>Veniqueur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The good angel
spares not his blows upon the corpse and the
evil spirit, until the latter, beaten and disabled,
abandons his prey, who by Allah’s
mercy is finally accepted within the fold of
the true believers.</p>

<p>This scene, however, is revealed to none by
the Imam, and remains a secret between Allah,
the departed, and himself. I have questioned
several Mohammedans of different
classes about this superstition, and they all
appear to believe in it implicitly. Most credulous
are the women, who embellish the tale
with Oriental exaggeration and wonderful
fancies that pass description.</p>

<p>The funeral ceremonies of the women are
similar to those of the men, with the exceptions,
that the washing is done by women
screened from view, and that when the body
is laid upon the “couch of comfort,” the
face, as well as the body, is half covered, instead
of the body only. During the procession
the only apparent difference is that, instead
of the fez on the peg at the head of the
coffin, one sees the <i>chimber</i>, or coif.</p>

<p>The necessity of immediate burial in hot
climates where Islam had its birth and passed
its childhood must have been the cause of
the adoption of the custom in Turkey. It
has the disadvantage, that in the time of an
epidemic, such as cholera, a great number of
people are falsely taken for dead and buried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
alive; but when accident reveals the disturbed
condition of these unfortunate beings
to the living, instead of exciting the horror
of relations, the disturbance is universally
attributed to struggles with evil spirits after
burial. Few invalids receive regular medical
attendance, and post-mortem examinations
are unheard of.</p>

<p>It is considered sinful for parents to manifest
extreme sorrow for the loss of their children;
for it is believed that the children of
over-mourning parents are driven out of
Paradise and made to wander about in darkness
and solitude, weeping and wailing as
their parents do on earth. But it is the reverse
with the case of children bereaved of
their parents; they are expected never to
cease sorrowing, and are required to pray
night and day for their parents’ forgiveness
and acceptance into Paradise.</p>

<p>Part of the personal effects of the deceased
is given to the poor, and charity distributed,
according to the means of the family. On
the third day after the funeral, <i>loukmas</i>
(doughnuts), covered with sifted sugar, are
distributed to the friends of the family and
to the poor, for the benefit of the soul of the
departed. The ceremony is repeated on the
seventh and the fortieth days, when bread is
also distributed. These acts of charity are
supposed to excite the gratitude of the departed,
if already in Paradise, and if in “another
place” to occasion him a moment of
rest and comfort.</p>

<p>External marks of mourning are not in
usage among the Turks. Nothing is changed
in the dress or routine of life in consequence
of a death in a family. Visits of condolence
are, however, paid by friends, who, on entering,
express their sympathy by the saying,
<i>Sis sagh oloun evlatlarounouz sagh olsoun</i>
(“May you live, and may your children
live”), with other expressions of a similar
nature. Friends and relatives say prayers at
stated times for the soul of the departed. On
my mentioning to a Turkish lady that I was
about to visit a common friend who a year
before had lost a beautiful daughter of fourteen
years, she begged me to say that her
two girls, friends of the child, never failed to
offer prayers for the departed soul every day
at noon. After the first outbreak of grief,
both men and women become calm and quite
collected in appearance, and speak of the
event as one that could not have been averted
by human help.</p>

<p>When a dervish sheikh of repute dies, his
remains are followed to the grave by all the
members of his brotherhood, by dervishes of
the other orders, and a large concourse of the
population. It is a most impressive and interesting
sight: the long procession slowly
winding through the narrow streets, the variety
of costumes presented by the numerous
orders of the dervishes, some with flowing
robes and high sugar-loaf hats, others with
white felt caps and green or white turbans;
all with bowed heads and looks of deep humility,
uttering at intervals the sacred word
<i>Allah</i>! On passing a mosque or <i>tekké</i>, the
coffin is deposited in front of the gate, and a
service is chanted, the congregation joining
in the refrain of <i>Amin! Amin!</i> when the
body is again taken up and the procession
resumed.</p>

<p>The long survival of ancient customs is a
continual subject of surprise and interest;
but nowhere is their seeming immortality
more remarkable than among the subject
races of Turkey. The Greeks, whether residents
of Greece, Macedonia, Epirus, or other
parts of south-east Europe, have in many
respects become assimilated to the different
races among whom they live; but nowhere
do they appear to have lost in any marked
degree the characteristic features of their nationality—their
language or their ancient customs.
Christianity and other causes have
modified many of the ancient ceremonies,
but a rich heritage still remains to certify
their origin and bear testimony to the antiquity
of their descent. Among the most
striking of these heirlooms are the funeral
rites, in which the modern Greeks closely
preserve the traditions of their ancestors.
The fundamental points in these ceremonies
are the same among Greeks wherever they
may be, and are everywhere observed by
them with religious care.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the funeral
ceremonies observed in Macedonia and in
other parts of European Turkey.</p>

<p>At the approach of death a priest is sent
for to administer the sacrament to the sick
man. The family gather round the couch,
give the dying person the kiss of farewell,
and press down his eyelids when his soul has
departed. His couch and linen are changed,
and after being anointed with oil and wine,
and sprinkled with earth, he is dressed in his
most gorgeous apparel upon a table covered
with a linen cloth, with the feet pointing towards
the door, with hands crossed on the
breast, and limbs stretched out to their full
extent. A stone is placed in the room and left
there for three days. Friends watch round
the body, chanting Myriologia,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> or dirges,
lamenting his loss and illustrating his life
and the cause of his death. Tapers are kept
burning all night round the body, which is
decorated with flowers and green branches.
A cup is placed on the body and buried with
it; after the expiration of three years it is
taken out and treasured in the family.
Should a person suffer from the effects of
fright, water is given to him in this cup
without his knowledge, which is supposed to
prevent any ill consequences. The interment
usually takes place on the day following
the death. Invited friends assemble at
the house of mourning, the priests arrive, and
the coffin, uncovered, is wreathed with flowers.
The <i>obol</i> of the ancients, the ναῦλον for
Charon, is not forgotten; a small coin is
placed between the lips, and a cake, soaked
in wine, is eaten by the company, who say,
Ὁ θεὸς συγχωρήσει τόν. After the preliminary
prayers have been offered, the funeral
procession proceeds to the church. Crosses
are carried by the clergy and lighted tapers
by others. The coffin is borne on the shoulders
of men, and black streamers, ταινια, attached
to it are held by the elders of the community
or the persons of greatest importance
present.</p>

<p>Prayers are chanted as the funeral train
slowly proceeds to the church, where the
body is placed in the nave. When the prayers
and funeral mass are concluded, the
priest tells the relatives and intimate friends
of the deceased to give him the farewell kiss.
On arriving at the cemetery, the bier is placed
by the side of the grave, the last prayers are
offered, the coffin-lid is nailed down, and the
body is lowered into the earth. After the
priest has thrown in a spadeful of gravel in
the form of a cross, the spade is passed to the
relatives, who do the same in turn, with the
words Ὁ θεὸς συγχωρήσει τὴν ψυχὴν τοῦ
(“God rest his soul”). The bier is then
again covered with the pall, and the grave is
filled up. On returning to the house of sorrow,
water and towels are offered to the
guests for washing their hands. They then
sit down to a repast, at which fish, eggs, and
vegetables alone are eaten.</p>

<p>The mourning worn by Greeks is similar
to that of other European nations; all ornaments,
jewelry, and colored apparel are set
aside, and both sexes dress in plain black,
and in some instances dress their furniture in
covers of the same mournful hue. The men
often let their beards grow as a sign of sorrow,
and women frequently cut off their hair
at the death of their husbands, and bury it
with them; I have known many instances of
this custom. In Epirus and Thessaly a widow
would lose respect if she contracted a second
marriage, and in other parts it would be
strictly prohibited by custom.</p>

<p>On the evenings of the third, ninth,
twentieth, and fortieth days, masses are
said for the soul of the departed. These are
called <i>kolyva</i>. On the fortieth <i>kolyva</i>, two
sacks of flour are made into bread, and a loaf
sent to every family of friends as an invitation
to the service held in the church. Boiled
wheat is placed on a tray, and ornamented,
if for a young person, with red and white
sugar; if for an elderly person, with white
only. This is sent to the church previously,
prayers are read over it, and every person
takes a handful, saying Ὁ θεὸς συγχωρήσει
τόν, and a small bottle of wine is presented
to the priests.</p>

<p>On the following morning the friends assemble
at the house of mourning, and take
more boiled wheat to church. On returning,
they sit down to a meal, after again saying
Ὁ θεὸς συγχωρήσει τόν. This concluded,
they proceed to the grave, accompanied by
the priest, and erect a tombstone. A feast is
subsequently given to the poor.</p>

<p>Tapers are kept burning in the house for
forty days. On the last of these a list of the
ancestors of the deceased is read, and prayers
are offered for their souls. These ceremonies
are repeated at intervals during the
space of three years, at the expiration of
which the tomb is opened, and if the body is
sufficiently decomposed, the bones are collected
in a cloth, placed in a basket, dressed
in fine raiment, adorned with flowers, and
taken to church, where they are left for nine
days. Every evening the relatives go to say
prayers, and take boiled wheat to the church.
If the person had been of some standing,
twelve priests and a bishop perform mass.
The bones are then put in a box, surmounted
by a cross, and replaced in the tomb.</p>

<p>Should the body not be sufficiently decomposed
at the end of the three years, it is
supposed to be possessed, and for three years
longer the same prayers and ceremonies are
repeated.</p>

<p>The funeral ceremonies of the Bulgarians
differ from those of the Greeks only in their
preliminary usages. The religious service is
very similar. The sacrament is administered
to the dying person, and his last hours are
cheered by the presence of relatives and
friends.</p>

<p>After death he is laid upon a double mattress
between sheets, and completely dressed
in his gala costume, with new shoes and
stockings. A pillow of home-spun is filled
with handfuls of earth by all the persons
present, and placed under the head.</p>

<p>A curious idea prevails that messages can
be conveyed by the departing soul to other
lost friends by means of flowers and candles,
which are deposited on a plate placed on the
breast of the corpse.</p>

<p>An hour after death a priest comes to read
prayers for the dead, tapers are lighted, and
dirges chanted until the following morning,
when the clergy again arrive to accompany
the body to its last resting-place. Mass is
performed in the church, and when the procession
reaches the grave a barrel of wine is
opened, and boiled wheat, with loaves, are
distributed to all present, who say <i>Bogda prosti</i>
(“God have mercy on his soul”). The
gay costume is taken off, and libations of oil
and wine poured on the body; the shroud is
drawn over the face, the coffin nailed down
and lowered into the grave.</p>

<p>Returning to the house of mourning, the
company wash their hands over the fire, and
three days afterwards everything in the
house is washed. The objects that cannot
be washed are sprinkled with water and exposed
to the air for three days, given to the
poor, or sold.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the <i>kolyva</i> are the same
as among the Greeks, and the bones are disinterred
at the end of three years, with the
same observances.</p>

</div>

<p>The absence of any approach to sound
education of the most rudimentary kind
throughout the country is among the prime
causes of the present degraded condition of
the Turks. Both at home and at school the
Moslem learns almost nothing that will serve
him in good stead in after life. Worse than
this, in those early years spent at home,
when the child ought to have instilled into
him some germ of those principles of conduct
by which men must walk in the world
if they are to hold up their heads among civilized
nations, the Turkish child is only
taught the first steps towards those vicious
habits of mind and body which have made
his race what it is. The root of the evil is
partly found in the harem system. So long
as that system keeps Turkish women in their
present degraded state, so long will Turkish
boys and girls be vicious and ignorant.</p>

<p>Turkish mothers have not the slightest
control over their children. They are left to
do very much as they like, become wayward,
disobedient, and unbearably tyrannical. I
have often noticed young children, especially
boys, strike, abuse, and even curse their
mothers, who, helpless to restrain them, either
respond by a torrent of foul invective, or, in
their maternal weakness, indulgently put up
with it, saying, “<i>Jahil chojuk, né belir?</i>”
(“Innocent child! what does it know?”)</p>

<p>I was once visiting at a Pasha’s house,
where, among the numerous company present,
a shrivelled-up old lady made herself
painfully conspicuous by the amount of
rouge on her cheeks. The son of my hostess,
an impudent little scamp of ten years, independently
marched in, and, roughly pulling
his mother by her skirt, demanded a <i>beshlik</i>
(shilling); she attempted a compromise, and
offered half the sum, when the young rascal,
casting side glances at the painted old lady,
said, “A whole <i>beshlik</i>, or I will out with all
you said about that <i>hanoum</i> and her rouged
cheeks, as well as that other one’s big nose!”
My friend, exceedingly embarrassed, under
this pressure, acceded to her son’s demand,
the only way she could see of getting rid of
his troublesome company.</p>

<p>As a general rule the manner in which
children use their mothers among the lower
classes is still worse, and quite painful to
witness. When these youngsters are not at
school they may be seen playing in the street,
paddling in the water near some fountain,
making mud-pies, or playing with walnuts
and stones, at times varying their amusements,
in some retired quarter, by annoying
Christian passers-by, calling out <i>Giaour
gepek!</i> (“Infidel dog”), and throwing stones
at them. Under the parental roof they express
their desires in an authoritative tone,
calling out disrespectful exclamations to their
mothers.</p>

<p>Should their requests meet with the slightest
resistance, they will sit stamping with
their feet, pounding with their hands, clamoring
and screaming, till they obtain the desired
object. The mothers, who have as
little control over themselves as over their
children, quickly lose their temper, and begin
vituperating their children in language
of which a very mild but general form is,
<i>Yerin dibiné batasen!</i> (“May you sink under
the earth!”)<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Turkish children are not favored with the
possession of any of the instructive books,
toy-tools, games, etc., that European ingenuity
has invented for the amusement of children,
and which may be obtained at Constantinople
and other cities of Turkey; the
only playthings they possess are rattles, trumpets,
a rude species of doll (made of rag-bundles),
cradles, and a kind of <i>polichinello</i>, fashioned,
in the most primitive manner, of
wood, and decorated with a coarse daub of
bright-colored paint, applied without any regard
to artistic effect. These are sometimes
sold in the chandlers’ shops, but are only exposed
for sale in large quantities during the
Bairams, when they make their appearance,
piled in heaps on a mat, in the thoroughfares
nearest the mosques.</p>

<p>A Turkish child is never known to take a
cold bath in the morning; is never made to
take a constitutional walk, or to have his
limbs developed by the healthy exercise of
gymnastics. No children’s libraries exist, to
stimulate the desire for study—for which, it
is true, little taste is displayed. Among the
higher classes an unnaturally sedate deportment
is expected from children when in the
presence of their father and his guests, before
whom they present themselves with the
serious look and demeanor of old men, make
a deep salaam, and sit at the end of the room
with folded hands, answering with extreme
deference the questions addressed to them.
Out of sight, and in the company of menials,
they have no restraint placed upon them, use
the most licentious language, and play nasty
practical jokes; or indulge in teasing the
women of the harem to any extent; receiving
all the time the most indecent encouragement,
both by word and action, from the
parasites, slaves, and dependants hanging
about the house. No regular hours are kept
for getting up and going to bed. The children,
even when sleepy, obstinately refuse to
go to their beds, and prefer to stretch themselves
on a sofa, whence they are carried fast
asleep. On rising, no systematic attention is
paid either to their food, ablutions, or dressing.
A wash is given to their faces and
hands; but their heads, not regularly or daily
combed, generally afford shelter to creeping
guests, that can only be partially dislodged
at the <i>Hammam</i>.</p>

<p>Their dress, much neglected, is baggy and
slovenly at all times; but it becomes a ridiculous
caricature when copied from the European
fashion; shoes and stockings are not
much used in the house, but when worn, the
former are unfastened, and the latter kept up
by rags hanging down their legs. A <i>gedjlik</i>
(night-dress) of printed calico, an <i>intari</i>
(dressing-gown), <i>ayak-kab</i> (trousers), and a
<i>libardé</i> (quilted jacket), worn in the house,
do duty both by night and day.</p>

<p>Children are allowed to breakfast on anything
they find in the larder or buy from the
hawkers of cakes in the streets.</p>

<p>No person exercising the functions of governess,
nursery governess, or head nurse, exists
in harems. There is no reserve of language
observed before young girls, who are
allowed to listen to conversations in which
spades are very decidedly called spades. The
absence of refined subjects naturally leads the
tone of these conversations, at times, to so
low a level as to render its sense quite unintelligible
to the European listener, though it
is perfectly understanded of the Turkish
maiden.</p>

<p>Turks sometimes have <i>hodjas</i> as tutors for
their sons; but these are not always professional
instructors of youth, and their supervision
over their pupils seldom extends beyond
the hours of study. The <i>hodjas</i>, belonging
to religious orders, are grave, sanctimonious
persons; having little in common
with their pupils, who find it difficult to exchange
ideas with them, and thus to benefit
in a general way by their teaching. Poor
<i>effendis</i> or <i>kyatibs</i> are sometimes engaged to
fill the office of tutors, but their inferior position
in the house deprives them of any serious
control over their charges. The <i>dadi</i>,
appointed to attend upon the child from its
earliest infancy, plays a great part during its
youthful career; her charge, seldom separated
from her, will, if she be good and respectable,
benefit by her care; but if she be the
reverse, her influence cannot be anything but
prejudicial, especially to boys, whose moral
education, entirely neglected at this stage,
receives a vicious impulse from this associate.
The fact that the <i>dadi’s</i> being the property
of his parents gives him certain rights
over her is early understood and often abused
by the boy.</p>

<p>I have seen an instance of the results of
these boyish connections in the house of a
Pasha, who, as a child, had formed a strong
attachment for his <i>dadi</i>, and, yielding to her
influence, had later been induced to marry
her, although at the time she must have been
more than double his age. When I made
her acquaintance she was an old woman, superseded
by four young companions, whose
lives she made as uncomfortable as she could
by way of retaliation for the pain her husband’s
neglect was causing her. The fourth
and youngest of these wives, naturally the
favorite, nearly paid with her life for the
affection she was supposed to have diverted
from the <i>Bash Kadin</i> (first wife); for the
quondam <i>dadi</i>, taking advantage of her rival’s
unconsciousness whilst indulging in a siesta,
tried to pour quicksilver into her ears. The
fair slumberer fortunately awoke in time;
and the attempted crime was passed over in
consideration of the culprit’s past maternal
services, and of the position she then held.</p>

<p>Next to the important functions of <i>dadi</i>
those of <i>lala</i> must be mentioned. He is a
male slave into whose care the children of
both sexes are intrusted when out of the
harem. He has to amuse them, take them
out walking, and to school and back. His
rank, however, does not separate him from
his fellow servants, with whom he still lives
in common; and when the children come
to him, he takes them generally first to their
father’s apartment, and then into the servants’
hall, where they are allowed to witness
the most obscene practical jokes, often played
upon the children themselves; and to listen
to conversations of the most revolting nature,
only to be matched I should think in western
Europe among the most degraded inhabitants
of the lowest slums. This is one
of those evil customs that cannot be other
than ruinous to the morality of Turkish children,
who thus from an early age get initiated
into subjects and learn language of which
they should for years be entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>The girls are allowed free access into the
<i>selamlik</i> up to the time they are considered
old enough to wear the veil; which, once
adopted, must exclude a female from further
intercourse with the men’s side of the house.
The shameful neglect girls experience during
childhood leaves them alone to follow their
own instincts; alternately spoiled and rudely
chastened by uneducated mothers, they grow
up in hopeless ignorance of every branch of
study that might develop their mental or
moral faculties and fit them to fulfil the duties
that must in time devolve upon them.</p>

<p>I am glad to say that, in this respect, a
change for the better is taking place at Constantinople:
the education of the girls
among the higher classes is much improved;
elementary teaching, besides instruction in
music and needlework, is given to them; and
a few are even so highly favored as to have
European governesses, who find their pupils
wanting neither in intelligence nor in good-will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to profit by their instruction. I have
known Turkish girls speak foreign languages,
but the number of such accomplished
young ladies is limited, owing partly
to the dislike which even the most enlightened
Turks feel to allowing their daughters
any rational independence; for the girls, they
say, are destined to a life of harem restraint
with which they would hardly feel better
satisfied if they had once tasted of liberty;
their life would only be less happy, instead of
happier; ignorance in their case being bliss,
it would be folly to make them wise!—If
true, only another argument for the overthrow
of the system.</p>

<p>Some time ago, when at Constantinople, I
visited an old friend, a Christian by birth,
but the wife of a Pasha. This lady, little
known to the <i>beau monde</i> of Stamboul, a
most ladylike, sweet woman, was married
when her husband was a student in Europe
and she a school-girl. She has held fast to
her religion, and her enlightened husband has
never denied her the rights of her European
liberty; though, when in the capital, she
wears the <i>yashmak</i>, out of <i>convenance</i>. Her
children are Mohammedans. The daughter,
now a young lady of eighteen, a most charming,
accomplished girl, is justly named “The
Budding Rose of the Bosphorus.” Some
Turkish ladies acquainted with this family
spoke of it to me as an example of perfection
worthy of study and imitation. A truly poetical
attachment binds the mother and
daughter together, and finding no congeniality
in their Mohammedan acquaintances,
in the simplicity of their retired life they
have become all in all to each other, and are
doted upon by the father and brother. It
was very pleasant to look upon the harmony
that existed in this family, notwithstanding
the wide differences in the customs and religions
of its members. For many years I
had lost sight of my friends, and at length
found them caged up in one of the lovely villas
on the Bosphorus; the mother now a
woman of forty, the daughter a slim, bright
fairy.</p>

<p>After the surprise caused by my visit and
the friendly greetings were over, Madame
B⸺, full of delight and happiness, related to
me the engagement of her daughter to one of
the wealthiest and most promising grandees
of <i>La Jeune Turquie</i>, who, having just completed
his studies in Paris, was expected in a
few days to come and claim her as his bride.
She was to dwell beneath the paternal roof,
and I was taken to visit the apartments that
had been prepared for the young couple.
They were most exquisitely furnished, with
draperies of straw-colored satin, richly embroidered
by the deft fingers of the ladies.
The mother, her face beaming with joy, said
to me, “Am I not happy in marrying my
daughter to an enlightened young Turk,
who, there is every reason to expect, will
prove as good and affectionate a husband to
her as mine has been to me?”</p>

<p>The young lady had known her affianced
before his departure for Paris; full of faith
and hope, she nourished a deep love for him,
and, in the innocent purity of her heart, felt
sure he responded to it.</p>

<p>I have not seen these ladies since, but a
short time after my visit I was deeply grieved
to hear that this seemingly well-adapted
match was broken off in consequence of the
young Bey having returned accompanied by
a French ballet-dancer, whom he declared he
did not intend to give up.</p>

<p>I have heard that, generally speaking,
Paris is not the most profitable school for
young Turks. Attracted by the immense
amount of pleasure and amusement there
afforded to strangers, they become negligent
students, waste their time and money in
profitless pursuits, keep company of the most
doubtful kind, are led to contract some of the
worst Parisian habits, and return to their
country, having acquired little more than a
superficial varnish of European manners.
These they proudly display; but at heart
they profoundly despise the nation whose
virtues they failed to acquire, whilst they
plunged freely into those vices which were
more congenial to their habits and nature.</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with Stamboul
life may remember the sensation caused in
1873 by a band of young Turkish ruffians,
who bore the name of <i>Tussun</i>, whose declared
object was to initiate the youth of both
sexes into those dark practices of the Asiatics
still so prevalent among the upper classes.
This abominable society was so strong that
the police were, for a time, powerless against
it. The chief of these vagabonds was stated
to be the son of a member of the Sultan’s
household, and the other young men were
connected with some high Turkish families.
It was only by the most active interference
of the minister of justice that this fraternity
was finally put down.</p>

<p>One of the great drawbacks the progress
of education meets with among the Turks is
the insurmountable repulsion Mohammedans
feel to freeing this movement from the fetters
of religion. The most enlightened of Turks
will be found wanting in good-will and assistance
when the question is that of promoting
the current of liberal ideas at the cost of
the religious dogmas which regulate all his
social habits; and these retrograde notions
cannot be openly repudiated even by those
who profess no belief in the religion upon
which they are supposed to be founded.
These sceptical Turks, possessing no distinct
conception of any philosophical school whose
aim should be to replace prejudice and superstition
by the propagation of free thought,
based upon morality and scientific research,
merely become reckless and unprincipled,
but are of no more use than the bigoted party
in helping forward an undenominational
movement in education.</p>

<p>Until quite recent times the only public
institutions for the education of the Turkish
youth were those common to all Moslem
countries, the <i>Mahallé Mektebs</i>, or primary
schools, and the <i>Medressés</i>, or Mosque-Colleges.
The <i>Mektebs</i> are to Turkey, though in
a still more inefficient way, what the old
National Schools were to England. They
are the universal, and till recently the only
existing, instruments of rudimentary education
for the children of both sexes of all
classes. Like the old-fashioned National
Schools, religion is the main thing taught;
only in the Turkish Mektebs religion is pretty
nearly the one thing taught. The little
Turkish boys and girls are sent to these
schools at a very early age, and pay for their
instruction the nominal fee of one piastre
(2¼<i>d.</i>) a month. Great ceremony attends the
child’s first entrance. Its hands are dyed
with henna; its head decorated with jewels;
and it is furnished with a new suit of clothes,
and an expensive bag called <i>Soupara</i>, in
which the <i>Mus-haf</i>, or copy of the Koran, is
carried. The father of the child leads it to
the Mekteb, where it recites the Moslem
creed to the Hodja, kisses his hand, and joins
the class. The other children, after the recital
of prayers, lead the novice home, headed
by the Hodja, who chants prayers all the
way along, the children joining in the response
of <i>Amin! Amin!</i> Refreshments and
ten paras (a halfpenny) are offered to each
child by the parents of the new scholar, on
receipt of which they make a rush into the
street and throng round the trays of the
numerous hawkers who collect round the
door on such occasions. This ceremony is
repeated on the first examination, for which
the Hodja receives £1 and a suit of linen.
The teaching in these schools was, until recently,
strictly limited to lessons from the
Koran. The scholars, amounting in number
sometimes to one or two hundred, are
closely packed together in a school-room
which is generally the dependence of the
Mosque. Kneeling in rows, divided into tens
by monitors who superintend their lessons,
they learn partly from the book and partly
by rote, all reading out the lesson at the same
time, and swaying their bodies backwards
and forwards. An old Hodja, with his assistant,
sits cross-legged on a mat at one end
of the room, before the chest which serves
the double purpose of desk and bookcase.
With the cane of discipline in one hand, a
pipe in the other, and the Koran before him,
the old pedagogue listens to and directs the
proceedings of the pupils. Unruly children
are subjected to the punishment of the cane
and the <i>Falakka</i>, a kind of wooden hobble
passed over the ankle of the culprit, who
sometimes has to return home wearing this
mark of disgrace. The Koran lessons, delivered
in Arabic, are gibberish to the children,
unless explained by the master; and
the characters used in Koran writing are not
well adapted for teaching ordinary Turkish
handwriting.</p>

<p>It is easily seen what ample room for improvement
there is in these establishments,
where Moslems spend the best part of their
childhood. Religion, taught in every-day
language, simplified and adapted to the understanding
of children, together with the
rudiments of ordinary knowledge, would lay
the foundation of a wiser and more profitable
system of education than all these many
years lost in poring over theological abstractions,
comprehensible glimpses of which can
only be conveyed to such young minds by
the explanations of the Hodja, who is sure
to dwell upon the most dogmatic and consequently
the most intolerant points of Islam,
and thus sows among the children ready-made
ideas, the pernicious seed of that fanaticism
which finds its early utterance in
the words <i>Kafir</i> and <i>Giaour</i> (infidel), and
prompts the little baby to measure himself
with his gray-bearded Christian neighbor, and
in the assurance of superior election raise his
hand to cast the stone of ineradicable contempt.</p>

<p>The finished scholars from these institutions
may become Hodjas themselves, acquiring,
if they choose, a knowledge of writing.
Such is the system of primary education
which has existed in Turkey ever since the
Conquest. Happily this century has seen
some improvements, not so much in the
Mektebs as in the introduction among them
of Government (so to say, Board) Schools on
improved principles.</p>

<p>No era of the Ottoman history presents a
more dismal picture of ignorance and incapacity
than the close of the last century.
The country appeared to be crumbling to
pieces; and the nation seemed lost in the two
extremes of apathy and fanaticism. Sultan
Mahmoud’s sagacious mind saw wherein the
evil lay, and attempted to remedy it by establishing
schools more after the European
model, and by this means spreading among
his people the liberal ideas that alone could
civilize and regenerate them. The difficulties
he encountered in his praiseworthy and
untiring efforts to bring about this change
were great and varied. Nevertheless, he
succeeded in establishing a few schools in the
capital, which have served as bases to those
that were instituted by his son and successor
Abdul-Medjid. These latter consisted first
of <i>Rushdiyés</i>, or preparatory schools, where
boys of all classes are admitted on leaving
the Mektebs, and are gratuitously taught
Turkish, elementary arithmetic, the history
of their country, and geography.</p>

<p>Next to these establishments come the
<i>Idadiyés</i>, or more advanced preparatory
schools, where boys are also admitted gratuitously,
and remain from three to five years;
they are instructed in the studies adapted to
the careers they are destined to follow in the
finishing medical, military, marine, and artillery
schools to which they gain admittance
on leaving the Idadiyés.</p>

<p>Besides these schools the capital contains
some others of equal importance, such as a
school for forming professors for the Rushdiyés,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
a school teaching foreign languages to
some of the <i>employés</i> of the Porte, a forest
school, and one for mechanics.</p>

<p>The original organization of all these institutions
is said to be good, but unfortunately
the regulations are not carried out. The absence
of a proper system of control and strict
discipline, a want of attention on the part of
the students, and of competence on that of
the professors, are the chief characteristics
of most of them.</p>

<p>In addition to the educational establishments
of the capital, Rushdiyés have also
been opened in all large country towns, and
in some even Idadiyés. It is, perhaps,
hardly necessary to state that there are no
schools of any kind in country villages; the
three R’s are there regarded as wholly superfluous
luxuries.</p>

<p>Had the Turks followed up more systematically
the movement thus happily begun;
had it become general throughout the country,
and been marked by proper care and
perseverance, many of the evils which now
beset Turkey might perhaps have been
avoided. The contempt for the Christian
generally displayed by the Moslem, engendered
through ignorance and fanaticism,
might have been softened into tolerance, and
a more friendly feeling might have been created
between them.</p>

<p>Education, however, received another impetus
during the administration of Ali and
Fouad Pashas, who by their united efforts
succeeded in creating new schools and slightly
improving those already existing.</p>

<p>Most of these institutions, excepting the
medical college, were formerly open to Christian
children only in name; under Ali and
Fouad they became open in reality to a few,
who took their places by the side of the Mohammedan
boys.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the Turkish
schools in the town of Salonika, which contains
about 15,000 Mohammedan inhabitants,
including 2500 <i>Dulmés</i>, or Jews converted
to the faith of the Prophet:—seven <i>Mahallé
Mektebs</i>, or “National” schools; one <i>Mekteb
Rushdiyé</i>, or Government school; one small
private school for Turkish girls, established
about twelve mouths ago; and two special
schools for the Dulmés, one for girls and
another for boys. The <i>Mekteb Rushdiyé</i> is
supported by the Government, and has one
superintendent and two masters, and is attended
by 219 children, all day pupils.
Teaching is divided into four classes; the
first comprises poetry, the Turkish, Arabic,
and Persian languages; the second, logic,
mathematics, elementary arithmetic, and the
rudiments of geography; the third, cosmography,
Ottoman and universal history, writing;
the fourth, preparatory lessons for beginners.</p>

<p>The mathematical and historical teaching
is very deficient, and the whole system of instruction
needs much improvement. Students
on leaving this school may enter the
Harbiyé, or military school, at Monastir, or
continue their studies at the <i>Medressé</i>, where
the Softas and Ulema graduate, or may attach
themselves to some Government office
as unsalaried Kyatibs, or scribes, called
<i>Chaouch</i>, until a vacancy or some other
chance helps them to a lucrative post.</p>

<p>The Dulmés, who are found in large numbers
only at Salonika, have of late years
shown a great desire to promote education
among both sexes of their small but thriving
community. The course of study followed
in their boys’ school is similar to that of
the <i>Rushdiyé</i>, and, of course, includes the
very elementary curriculum of the National
schools. It has four classes, subdivided each
into three forms; three masters, aided by
monitors, superintend the studies. I visited
this school, and found a great lack of order
and discipline. First-class boys, seated on
benches and before desks, were mixed up
with the little ones, who, I was told, were
placed there in order to be broken in to the
school routine—a strange arrangement, unlikely
to benefit either; at least it had been
better for these mere infants to be placed in
a class where lessons and exercises suited to
their years were taught. Some of the big
boys were examined, and, as far as I was
able to judge, seemed well advanced in writing
and in the knowledge of the Turkish language,
but they did not appear equally well
versed in mathematics or the scientific
branches of study, which were evidently
taught in a very elementary form, if one
might judge by the simple questions put by
the masters. This examination was concluded
by the senior boys chanting in chorus
the names of the days of the week and the
months of the year! It must be borne in
mind, however, that this establishment, which
is said to be the best in the town, was opened
only eighteen months ago.</p>

<p>With regard to the higher branches of
study, I was far more edified during an examination
of the <i>Rushdiyé</i> and <i>Harbiyé</i>
schools at Adrianople, where some of the
pupils had produced well-executed maps and
drawings, and had also distinguished themselves
in mathematics; the schools of that
town seemed to be of a higher standard than
those of Salonika, although, like all Turkish
schools, they left much to be desired in good
principles, refinement, and general enlightenment,
to all of which a marked disregard
is universally displayed. The comparative
progress made in the above-mentioned subjects
should not, however, be considered a
criterion of the cultivation of art and science
in general. In spite of the simplicity with
which these various branches of science and
of art may now be taught, they are not likely
to make much advancement among the Mohammedans.
These people display an astonishing
apathy and a total absence of the
spirit of inquiry and research with regard to
everything. They confide the secrets of
nature, to the supreme care of Allah, and
deem it superfluous to trouble themselves
with such subjects beyond the extent required
for their common wants. All mental
effort is in direct opposition to the listless
habits of the Turk, and, since he is not the
man to run against the will of Providence,
who fashioned his disposition, is therefore
seldom attempted. Professional men are rare
among them, and such as there are can only
be ranged in the class of imitative mediocrities,
who have not the genius to improve or
develop any useful branch of science.</p>

<p>The Dulmé girls’ school of Salonika was
held in a house containing a number of small
rooms, in which the pupils were huddled
together. One of these rooms was fitted up
with desks and benches that might have accommodated
about thirty children; when I
entered all the pupils were doing needlework;
Shemshi Effendi, the director, a
young man of some enterprise and capacity
and a good deal of intelligence, led the way
and ordered all to stand up and salaam; a
lesson I hope they will condescendingly bear
in mind and practise later on in life in their
intercourse with Christians. They were
learning plain sewing, crochet, tapestry, and
other ornamental work, taught by a neat-looking
Greek schoolmistress. A good many
of the pupils were grown-up girls, who sat
with veils on. The master pointed them out
to me, saying that most of those young ladies
were engaged to be married; “I have not,
therefore, attempted to teach them reading or
writing, as they are too old to learn, and
their time here is very short, but with the
little ones I hope in time to do more.” Some
of the latter were examined before me in
reading, writing, and arithmetic, in which
they seemed to have got on very fairly considering
the short time they had attended the
school and the utter want of order and system
prevailing in it.</p>

<p>The general appearance of the girls was
that of negligent untidiness; their hair was
uncombed, and most of them were seated on
the ground working, with a total absence of
that good breeding which was to be expected
in a well-regulated school for girls of their
age and condition.</p>

<p>Defective as this establishment is, it is deserving
of praise and encouragement as a
first attempt which may lead to a higher
standard of education among Turkish women.
Perhaps some of the institutions at
Stamboul, though now greatly improved, had
no higher origin. Conversing lately about
these with an intelligent Turk, I was assured
that some of the young Turkish girls had so
much profited by the education afforded in
them as to have made great progress in composition
and even novel-writing, an unprecedented
event in the lives of the ladies of this
nation! Some have devoted themselves to
the study of French, and have translated one
or two little French works into Turkish.
One of these institutions has now become a
training college for teachers, who are sent as
mistresses into other schools.</p>

<p>The Turkish girls’ school of Salonika is
attended by forty-eight pupils, superintended
by one master, and a Greek schoolmistress
for needlework. It is hardly necessary to
say that the instruction afforded is very defective,
and can be of little practical use to
young girls who often, after a few years of
childhood, leave when they attain the age of
ten or eleven, just when their young minds
are beginning to take in what is taught them.
However, a little is always better than nothing,
and it is to be hoped that the Salonika
girls’ schools will pave the way to more
effective means of teaching.</p>

<p>Excepting one or two schools founded by
Midhat Pasha, in the vilayet of the Danube,
no other Moslem girls’ schools but these at
Stamboul and Salonika exist in Turkey. It
must be the vegetating existence of these few
establishments that has caused the flowing
pen of one writer on Bulgaria to scatter girls’
schools profusely all over the country, placing
one even in the remotest village of the
Balkans; in all these schools, according to
him, girls are everywhere taught to read and
write! The statement is, unfortunately,
only another proof of the accuracy of the saying,
that a thing may be too good to be true.</p>

<p>The foundation of the <i>Lyceum</i> at Constantinople,
decided upon in 1868, was due to
Ali and Fouad Pashas. The object of this
institute was to spread knowledge and education
throughout the country, irrespective
of creed and nationality, and thus to attempt
to break through the mischievous routine of
separate education, and to bring together all
the youth of Turkey with the view to establishing
better relations between the different
races, creeds, and parties. The task was not
an easy one. The history of the opposition
encountered by the director and professors
at the opening of the college will give a
slight idea of the difficulties and obstacles
the Government itself meets with in the management
of its subjects.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty purses were voted
for the Lyceum, to be expended for the benefit
of all Ottoman subjects, whether Moslems,
Catholic or Gregorian Armenians,
Roman Catholics, Greeks, Bulgarians, or
Jews. Foreign subjects were only admitted
on the payment of fees.</p>

<p>It was intended to establish branches of
the Lyceum in the principal towns, but this
project was soon given up. The administration,
as well as the direction of the greater
part of the studies, was confided to French
functionaries, chosen by the Minister of
Public Instruction in France, subject to the
approval of the Turkish Minister of the same
department. The lessons were to be given
in French, and comprised literature, history,
geography, elementary mathematics, and
physical science. The Arabic, Persian, and
Turkish languages were to be taught by
Turkish professors. Greek and Latin were
to be taught, partly to facilitate the acquisition
of a knowledge of scientific terms, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
partly because Greek was of daily utility to
the greater part of the students.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan religious instruction
was confided to an <i>Imam</i>, but the spirit of
tolerance had gained sufficient ground in the
customs of the establishment to allow its
members to practise their different creeds at
will amidst their comrades, and it is said to
have been a most interesting sight to witness
their devotions.</p>

<p>In spite of (or rather on account of) the
liberality and tolerance of the original bases
of this institute, and the constant endeavor
of the directors to accommodate these bases
as much as possible to the habits and ideas of
the members of the different races there represented,
none seemed to feel the satisfaction
and content that was expected. The Mohammedans
naturally demanded that the
Koran laws and its exhortations regarding
prayer, ablutions, the fasting of Ramazan by
day and the feasting by night, should be respected.
The Jews, rigid observers of their
traditions, rebelled against the idea of their
children being placed in an institute directed
by Christians, and of their partaking in common
of food that was Tourfa, or unlawful.
The Greeks followed, complaining that their
language was not sufficiently admitted into
the course of studies; and the well-to-do
members of that community abstained from
sending their children there. The Roman
Catholics had religious scruples caused by a
special prohibition of the Pope, and were under
pain of deprivation of the sacraments if
they placed their children in an infidel institution.
Armenian pretension required
that special attention should be paid to the
children belonging to that community, and
the Bulgarians demanded that a strict line
should be drawn between their children and
those of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Next to this came the difficulty about the
Day of Rest: the Turks claiming Friday, the
Jews Saturday, and the Christians Sunday;
allied to this point of dispute was that of the
observance of the religious and national festivals,
all falling on different days. Even the
masters themselves, Turks, Armenians, English
and French men, Greeks and Italians, by
the variety of nationalities they represented,
still further complicated the matter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a country where education
is so expensive and so difficult to obtain
as it is in Turkey, there were not wanting
liberal-minded people who were willing
to pass over these niceties for the sake or
the counterbalancing advantages; and at
the opening of the Lyceum, 147 Mohammedan,
48 Gregorian Armenian, 86 Greek, 34
Jew, 34 Bulgarian, 23 Roman Catholic, and
19 Armenian Catholic students applied for
admission, forming a total of 341.</p>

<p>At the end of two years their numbers
were almost doubled, for as long as Ali and
Fouad Pashas had the direction the institution
continued to prosper and to give satisfaction
to those who had placed their children
in it; but after the death of these true
benefactors of Turkey everything changed
for the worse.</p>

<p>The French director, disgusted with the
intrigues that surrounded him and the interference
he then met with in the performance
of his functions, sent in his resignation and
returned to Villa Franca; and within a
month 109 pupils were withdrawn.</p>

<p>The post of director was successively filled
by men whose mismanagement provoked so
much discontent as to cause the still greater
reduction in the number of students from
640 to 382.</p>

<p>The following extract from an article by
M. de Salve in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
15th Oct., 1874, contains a pretty correct estimate
of the talent, capacity, and general
good conduct of the pupils that attended the
Lyceum:</p>

<p>“After three years in the month of June,
1871, eight pupils of the Lyceum received the
French decree of <i>Bachelier des Sciences</i> before
a French Commission, and in the following
years similar results were obtained.</p>

<p>“When the starting-point is considered
and the progress made reflected upon, it will
be admitted that it was impossible to foresee,
or hardly to hope, for success. The degree
that was attained bears testimony to the value
and devotion of the masters as much as to
the persevering industry and good-will of the
pupils. In general, the progress made in the
various branches of study, and particularly
in that of the French language, and in the
imitative art, has surpassed all our hopes,
and in this struggle of emulation between
pupils of such varied extractions, the most
laudable results have been accomplished.</p>

<p>“We should then be wrong in looking
upon the Eastern races as having become incapable
of receiving a serious intellectual
culture, and condemning them to final and
fatal inaction. It may be interesting to know
which nationalities have produced the most
intelligent and best-conducted pupils. In
these respects the Bulgarians have always
held the first rank, and after them the Armenians,
then the Turks and Jews, and lastly,
I regret to say, the Roman Catholics. The
Greeks, in addition to some good characters,
presented a great many bad ones.”</p>

<p>The supremacy of the Bulgarians is a fine
augury for the coming state of things; and
that the Greeks and Roman Catholics should
not have greatly distinguished themselves
need not surprise us; for all the children of
the better classes of these communities are
educated in schools kept by professors of
their own persuasion. One of the reasons
why the Lyceum has been abandoned by the
majority of the Christian pupils is its removal
to Stamboul, which made it very difficult
for their children to attend, together
with the radical changes which have taken
place in its administration and in the tone,
which has now become quite Turkish.</p>

<p>In describing the improvements effected by
Ali and Fouad Pashas upon the old Moslem
Mekteb, we have been led away from the
other primeval Moslem institution, the
<i>Medressé</i>, or Mosque College. These Medressés,
supported by the funds of the
mosques to which they are attached, are the
universities where the Softas and Ulema, and
lower down the Imams and Kyatibs, study,
and, so to speak, graduate. The subjects
taught are much the same as in the Medressés
of other Mohammedan countries. Language
and theology are the main things in the eye
of the Ulema (or Dons) of a Medressé. Language
means grammar, rhetoric, poetry, calligraphy,
and what not, in Arabic, and
(though less essentially) in Persian and Turkish.
Theology includes the interpretation
of the Koran and traditions; and when we
have said that we have said enough for one
lifetime, as every one knows who knows anything
of Arab commentators and traditionists
and recommentators and traditionists commentated.
Theology, it should however be
added, of course includes Moslem law, since
both are bound together in the Koran and the
traditions of Mohammed. It may easily be
conceived that the instruction in these Medressés
was and is always of a stiff conservative
sort, not likely to advance in any great
degree the cause of general enlightenment in
Turkey. Still, since all the scholars and
statesmen of the country were, until quite
lately, invariably educated at the Medressés,
it cannot be denied that they have done service
in their time. Whatever historians,
poets, or literary men Turkey can boast of
more than a generation back, to the Medressés
be the credit! In the case of statesmen
the result of this training has not always
been very happy. It is not satisfactory to
know that in quite recent times a Minister of
Public Instruction (of the old school), sitting
upon a commission for looking into the state
of the schools of Turkey, on being shown
some maps and some mathematical problems
executed by the pupils, appeared entirely
ignorant of their meaning, and exclaimed,
“Life of me! Mathematics, geography,
this, that, and the other, what use is such
rubbish to us?”</p>

<p>Now, however, the highest classes send
their sons to Paris and elsewhere to be educated.
The effect of this training upon La
Jeune Turquie I have already noticed. In
some cases it must, nevertheless, be admitted
that the Turk educated in Europe has really
made good use of his time, and has raised
himself, as near as his nature permits, to the
level of the more civilized nations he has associated
with.</p>

<p>Such is the general state of education in
Turkey. Brought up, first by an ignorant
mother, then by the little less ignorant Hodja
of the Mekteb, or, in rarer cases, by the well-meaning
but still incompetent masters of the
Government schools, it is not surprising that
the ordinary Turk is crafty, ignorant, and
correspondingly fanatical. Yet dark as the
present position is, it is better than it was a
few years ago. The efforts of Ali and Fouad
Pashas have certainly given education a forward
impulse. The advance has been slow,
but it has been forward, not backward. In
this advance the Turks have shared far less
than the subject races. Were things as they
were two years ago, this could hardly be
taken as a hopeful sign; but, looking at it
from the opposite point of view, that the
Bulgarians and Greeks have advanced more
than the Turks, it must be admitted, in the
new arrangement of the provinces now negotiating,
that the fact carries a bright ray of
hope.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that the immense
progress made by Greece during the past half
century in education would exercise no influence
upon the Greeks in Turkey. The
people of the kingdom of Greece, secure of
their own freedom, released from that servile
condition to which centuries of oppressive
misrule had reduced them, and become citizens
of a liberty-loving country, have for the
past twenty years been using every effort to
promote the cause of liberty by the spread of
education among their brethren still in subjection
to the Porte. When the Turks conquered
the Greek provinces, they did their
best to extinguish education among their
Christian subjects: the Greek schools were
suppressed, new ones prohibited, and the
Greek children had to be taught during the
night.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But the monasteries, nests of ignorance
and vice as they were, were the principal
refuges of letters. Scattered all over the
empire, they enjoyed the privileges drawn
from the special liberty and favor granted by
the wise Sultan to the Greek clergy. This
was done by the Sultan with the view of acquiring
unlimited control over the Greek
rayahs, by giving a just sufficient amount of
power to a small but influential body of men,
to induce them to support his designs.
Mount Athos, one of these privileged asylums,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
became a famous resort of the retired
clergy. A college of some merit was also established
on this monastic spot for affording
secular instruction to Greek youths. At
Phanar, the secluded refuge of the Greek
noblesse, in right of their privileges, education
among the higher classes was promoted.
For a long time this was the only place Constantinople
could boast as supplying men of
letters, some of whom, being conversant with
foreign languages, were employed in European
embassies as interpreters. Within the
last fifty years the educational movement
among the Greeks of Turkey has altered its
course. Some schools established in the
country afforded elementary instruction to
the children, but, for the most part, they
were now sent to Athens and Syra to complete
their studies, where numerous schools
and colleges afforded them the means of acquiring
a perfect knowledge of their own
language and a tolerably good general education.
This migration, perseveringly continued
for nearly thirty years, increased the
number of these Athenian and Syraote establishments,
and the pecuniary benefit they
derived from it enabled them to perfect their
organization. Politics and learning were
two essential elements of education, which
the modern Greeks uphold with a tenacity
worthy of final success. The young Greek
rayah, sent to Athens, returns to his home a
scholar and a staunch Philhellene, burning
with an all-absorbing desire to instil his ideas
and feelings into the minds of his fellow
rayahs. Such currents flow slowly but
surely among a population that, debased as
it may be by a foreign yoke, has a history
and literature of its own to look back to.
The first students returning from Greece were
the pioneers of the immense progress that
education has lately made among the Greeks
in Turkey. None can realize and testify to
this better than those who have watched its
introduction and development in the interior.
As I stated in another part of this work, even
the élite of the Greek society of Broussa
thirty years ago had lost the use of their
mother-tongue, replacing it by broken Turkish.
Since then, the introduction of schools
has been the means of restoring the use of
their own language to the great majority of
the people, though one portion of the town is
still ignorant of it, in consequence of the
profitable occupation the silk factories afford
to girls, who are sent there from a very early
age, instead of going to school. The inhabitants
of the surrounding villages, in all of
which Greek schools have now been established,
have learnt their national language—a
proof that although the general attention
of the Greeks has naturally first been directed
to promoting education in Thessaly,
Macedonia, and Epirus, the scattered colonies
left on the Asiatic side have not been
altogether forgotten or neglected; they have
now good colleges in Smyrna, and schools in
less important towns and villages.</p>

<p>The Greek village of Demerdesh, between
Broussa and the seaport Moudania, merits
special praise for the wonderful progress,
both mental and material, it has made. It is
refreshing to see the intelligent features of
the inhabitants of this village, and their
independent and patriotic disposition. One
thinks involuntarily of some of the ancient
Greek colonies that from small beginnings
rose to great power and created for themselves
a noble history.</p>

<p>At Constantinople the Greeks possess several
rapidly improving educational establishments
for both sexes. The Syllogus, too, a
literary association for the promotion of
learning, has been lately instituted in all the
large towns of Turkey. Some years ago I
was travelling with the head mistress of the
girls’ school at Epibatæ, in the district of Silivri,
near Constantinople—an institution
which owes its origin and maintenance to the
generosity and philanthropy of Doctor
Sarente Archegenes, a native of the place,
who, having acquired just reputation and
wealth in the capital, did not forget his native
village, but furnished the means for
building and maintaining a school for girls
in 1796. This mistress was a clever and
well-educated lady from Athens, and she
described to me her pleasure at the quickness
displayed by these peasant girls in their
studies. The only drawback, she remarked,
to this work of progress is the absence of a
similar establishment for the boys, who, all
charcoal-burners by trade, ignorant and uncouth,
are rejected as husbands by the more
privileged sex. I believe since then the evil
has been removed by the establishment of a
boys’ school. How much more beneficial to
humanity was the establishment of these institutions
than that of the one founded by
Mehemet Ali Pasha of Egypt at Cavalla, his
native place. Desiring to benefit his country
with some of the wealth acquired in Egypt,
he requested the people of Cavalla to choose
between a school and a charitable establishment
or <i>Imaret</i>: the former was meant to
impart light and civilization among them, the
latter to furnish an abode for fanatical Softas,
and daily rations of pilaf and bread for three
hundred individuals. The Cavalla Turks
did not hesitate between the mental and material
food; and shortly after a substantial
edifice was erected, its perpetual income
helping to maintain a number of indolent
persons within its walls, and feed the refuse
of the population that lazily lounged about
outside, waiting for the ready food that rendered
labor unnecessary.</p>

<p>The wealthy Greek families at Constantinople
are now giving special attention to the
education of their children; the girls appear,
more especially, to have profited by it, for
the Greek ladies, as a class, are clever, well-informed,
and good linguists, well bred and
extremely pleasant in the intimacy of their
social circles. Most of them are musicians,
as the phrase is, some even attaining to excellence.
A French lady told me she had
heard a French ambassador state as his
opinion that the best and most enlightened
society in the capital was the Greek; but it
was so exclusive that an easy admission into
it was a privilege not to be enjoyed even by
an ambassador. I may state that my personal
experience allows me to coincide with
this view. The men, absorbed in business,
and perhaps still bearing the <i>cachet</i> of some
of those faults that prejudice is ever ready to
seize upon and exaggerate, are less refined and
agreeable in society than the women. Gifted
men, however, and men of a high standard
of moral integrity and good faith, are not rare
among them; and the munificence of such
men as Messrs Zarifi, Christaki, Zographo,
Baron Sina, and many others, in encouraging
the advancement of education, and helping
in the relief of the poor in time of want and
distress, has entitled them to the gratitude of
their nation.</p>

<p>Some time ago I was invited to attend
the μνημόσυνα, an anniversary at the girls’
school at Salonika, in remembrance of its
chief benefactress Kyria Castrio. A large
cake, iced and decorated with various devices,
was placed on a table facing the portrait
of this lady, which, garlanded with
flowers, appeared to look on smilingly and
contentedly, encircled by a ring of young
girls. The room was densely crowded with
guests and the relatives of the children.
Presently a great bustle was heard, and the
crowd opened to give passage to the dignified,
intellectual-looking Bishop, accompanied
by his clergy, who quietly walked up to
the cake, and read mass over it for the benefit
of the soul of the departed lady. This
ceremony concluded, he amiably shook hands
with some of the company nearest to him,
and took his seat at the rostrum used for
lectures. It was now the turn of the young
girls to express their gratitude to the memory
of her to whose kind thought and generosity
they owed in great part the education they
were receiving. This was conveyed in a
hymn composed for the occasion, and rendered
with much feeling and expression, under
the able direction of a young German
master, who, for the love of the art in general,
and the Greek nation in particular, had
kindly undertaken to give free lessons in
vocal music to the girls. Some of the elder
girls looked very pretty, and all seemed
bright and intelligent. The little ones, mustering
in a company of two hundred, were
next marched up in a double row, clasping
each other round the waist. It was a pretty
sight to see these little mites assembled round
the chair of the paternal Bishop, keeping
time with their feet to the tune, and singing
their little hymn. This interesting ceremony
was concluded by a long lecture, from one
of the masters of the establishment, delivered
in Greek. The profound attention with
which all listened to it was a proof that it
was understood and appreciated. These
Mnemosyné are held annually in many
towns, and even in secluded villages, in
memory of charitable persons who have
founded or largely endowed their schools.</p>

<p>While on the subject of the Salonika girls’
school, I may as well go on with it, and describe
its organization, the course of studies
followed in it, and the immense benefit it
has proved to the community. Tedious as
such a description is, it may be useful in giving
an idea of the many other similar institutions
scattered throughout the country. The
building, formerly I believe a Turkish Konak,
is in itself rather dilapidated: it consists
of two spacious halls, into which open a number
of class-rooms.</p>

<p>I inspected the classes, and was much
pleased to find that the teachers ably and
conscientiously fulfilled their duties, and
that the pupils apparently did them great
credit. The following is a list of the subjects
taught by a lady principal and two professors:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Upper Division.</span></p>

<p>I. Greek.—Translations of ancient Greek
authors and poets, with explanations, grammatical
analysis, and composition.</p>

<p>II. Catechism, with due theological instruction.</p>

<p>III. History of Greece.</p>

<p>IV. Mathematics, including mathematical
and geometrical geography.</p>

<p>V. Psychology.</p>

<p>VI. Παιδαγωγία.</p>

<p>VII. Plain and fancy needlework.</p>

<p>VIII. Vocal music.</p>

<p>IX. Physics.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Middle Division.</span></p>

<p class="center">(Taught by lady principal, one mistress, and
one professor.)</p>

<p>I. Greek and Greek writers.</p>

<p>II. Sacred history, and explanations of the
Gospels.</p>

<p>III. Mathematics.</p>

<p>IV. Natural history.</p>

<p>V. Political and physical geography.</p>

<p>VI. Universal history.</p>

<p>VII. Calligraphy.</p>

<p>VIII. Needlework and vocal music.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lower Division.</span></p>

<p class="center">(Taught by six mistresses and four pupil
teachers.)</p>

<p>I. Greek.—Reading, writing, modern
Greek grammar, with explanations of modern
Greek authors.</p>

<p>II. Sacred history and catechism.</p>

<p>III. Greek history.</p>

<p>IV. Arithmetic.</p>

<p>V. Natural history.</p>

<p>VI. Political geography, needlework, and
calligraphy.</p>

</div>

<p>The infant schools contained two hundred
scholars, who were seated on a gallery; four
pupil teachers, two on each side, were keeping
order, and the mistress was giving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
lesson of the day, illustrating it by one of
the many colored pictures that decorated the
walls of the apartment. The lesson, explained
by the teacher, is repeated by the
children in chorus, who are afterwards questioned.
The system followed in this school
appears to me the most successful and appropriate
way of teaching young children,
whose minds, impressed by the object-lessons,
and diverted by the variety of the exercises
they are made to perform, are better
able to understand and retain the knowledge
imparted to them. A lady, recently arrived
from Europe, who takes a great interest in
schools, told me that few establishments of
this kind in Europe could boast of better success.</p>

<p>The rudiments of the following lessons are
taught: Reading; elementary geography;
history; moral lessons; object-lessons; infantile
songs and games.</p>

<p>During our visit to the girls’ school we
stopped before each class, and a few girls
were called out and examined by the master
or mistress presiding over their studies. All
these girls were intelligent in appearance,
seemed well conversant with the subject in
question, and were ready with their answers.
Arithmetic and mathematics generally were
the only branches of study in which they appeared
deficient; but on the whole the instruction
(unfortunately limited to the Greek
language for want of funds) is excellent.
The needlework, both plain and ornamental,
is copied from models brought from Paris,
and the girls show as much skill in this department
as they do aptitude for study in
others.</p>

<p>I questioned the directress on the general
conduct and morality of the girls, and she
gave me the best account of both. No distinction
is made between the rich and poor;
they sit side by side in the same class, a custom
which, in countries where education is
more developed, would be intolerable, but
which, for the present, in a place where class
distinctions are not so great, tends to improve
the manners of the lower without prejudice
to those of the upper. The opinion
of the schoolmistress was, that the girls of
Salonika, whilst more docile and more easily
managed, were not less intelligent than the
Athenian girls, whose more independent
spirit often occasioned trouble in the
schools.</p>

<p>From this establishment has been formed
a training school for girls who wish to become
school-mistresses; six professors instruct
in the following subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Greek.</p>

<p>II. Universal history.</p>

<p>III. Mathematics (including arithmetic and
geometry).</p>

<p>IV. Physics, geology, and anthropology.</p>

<p>V. Philosophy, psychology, παιδαγωγία.</p>

<p>VI. Vocal, instrumental, and theoretical
music.</p>

<p>VII. Gymnastics and calligraphy.</p>

<p>VIII. Explanations of the Gospels.</p>

</div>

<p>Seven female students obtained their diplomas
this year (1877), and were sent into the
interior, where in their turn they will be
called upon to impart light and knowledge to
the girls of some little town or village.</p>

<p>During my travels I have often come
across these provincial schools, and found
much pleasure in conversing with the ladylike,
modest young Athenian women, who
had left home and country to give their
teaching and example to their less-favored
sisters in Turkey. I remember feeling a
special interest in two of these, whom I
found established in a flourishing Greek village
in a mountainous district of Macedonia.</p>

<p>I was invited into their little parlor, adjoining
the school. It was plain but very
neat, and the scantiness of the furniture was
more than atoned for by the quantity of
flowers and the many specimens of their
clever handiwork. The Chorbadji’s wives,
some of them wealthy, doted upon these
girls, who were generally looked up to and
called Kyria (lady); each wife vying with
the other in copying the dresses and manners
of these phenomenal beings transplanted
into their mountain soil. The children, too,
seemed devoted to their teachers, and delighted
in the instruction given them, while
the men of the village showed them all respect,
and seemed to pride themselves on the
future benefit their daughters and sisters
would derive from the teachings and good influence
of these ladies.</p>

<p>Having sufficiently enlarged upon the education
of the girls of Salonika, I will now pass
on to that of the boys, which is far more advanced.</p>

<p>The highest school for boys is called the
Gymnasium. It contains four classes, in
which six professors teach the following subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Greek: translation of Greek poetry and
prose, with analysis and commentary, grammatical
and geographical, historical, archæological,
etc.</p>

<p>II. Latin: translations from Latin authors
and poets, with analysis.</p>

<p>III. Scripture lessons: catechism, with
theological analysis and explanations.</p>

<p>IV. Mathematics: theoretical arithmetic,
geometry, algebra, and trigonometry.</p>

<p>V. Natural science, comprising the study
of geology, anthropology, physiology, and
cosmography.</p>

<p>VI. History: universal, and more especially
Greek.</p>

<p>VII. Philosophy, psychology, and logic.</p>

<p>VIII. French grammar, exercises and
translations from the best French authors.</p>

</div>

<p>The next Greek school contains three
classes, in which three masters teach the following
lessons:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Greek, in all its branches.</p>

<p>II. Sacred lessons, history, and catechism.</p>

<p>III. Mathematics, practical arithmetic, and
geometry.</p>

<p>IV. Natural history.</p>

<p>V. Political geography.</p>

<p>VI. Universal history.</p>

</div>

<p>In the middle school of this same town
there are four classes, each subdivided into
two; five masters teach the following lessons:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Greek: reading, writing, modern Greek
grammar; and explanations of modern Greek
authors.</p>

<p>II. Sacred history and catechism.</p>

<p>III. History of Greece.</p>

<p>IV. Mathematics and practical arithmetic.</p>

<p>V. Natural history.</p>

<p>VI. Political geography.</p>

<p>VII. Vocal music and gymnastics.</p>

</div>

<p>How often, when witnessing the perseverance
and energy displayed in promoting education
among the Greeks and Bulgarians,
have I heartily wished that some more of the
funds given by our philanthropists for the
purposes of conversion could find their way
into the educational channel, and help to
stimulate its progress!</p>

<p>Conversing on this subject with an intelligent
American missionary, settled amongst
the Bulgarians, I was told that the missionaries
found it hard to work upon the ignorant
and prejudiced, who distrust them and do
not listen willingly to their teaching. The
schoolmasters, the most enlightened among
the people, alone comprehend and appreciate
their object. He said, “Could we help
these people to help themselves through their
own schools by contributing to their support,
our work would prosper far better. Education,
destroying prejudice and superstition,
would pave the way to a simpler form of
worship; and those who really wish to benefit
ignorant humanity in a sensible and effective
manner ought to direct their efforts towards
the propagation of education, which
would finally lead to the end they have in
view.”</p>

<p>I also visited another Greek school at Salonika,
which was under the direction of a
Greek gentleman educated in Germany, who
has designed a new educational system
which, having had a fair trial, will eventually
be adopted in all the educational establishments
of the Greeks. The origin of this
institution does not date further back than
two years, and of all the schools I have visited
here and elsewhere, this certainly struck
me as being the best and the most perfect of
its kind. The children were divided into
classes, each of which was examined by the
master, the result of which greatly surprised
myself and some friends who were present.
The director, who justly took great pride in
his work, assured us that all these boys under
his care (whose ages did not exceed
eleven) in consequence of the quickness,
facility, and ability with which they received
his instructions, had learnt in one year what
he had been unable to teach in double that
space of time to children in Germany. He
added that he was constantly called upon to
answer a shower of questions and remarks
made by the pupils upon the theme of the
lesson, which, having explained, he allows
them time and liberty to discuss the difficult
points, until they had quite mastered them.
On their first entrance they appear listless
and uninterested, but as the love of knowledge
is developed and grows upon them, they
often, when school time is up, beg permission
to remain an hour longer in class.</p>

<p>The youngest were first examined in reading.
They read fluently from Homer, and
translated into modern Greek from chance
pages left for us to choose. While the director
was dwelling on some meteorological subject,
one little mite of six lifted up its finger
and said, “I noticed that the sky was very
cloudy yesterday, and yet it did not rain, may
I explain why?” Permission was at once
given, and he enlightened us on the subject.
All the questions put to the senior boys in
mathematics and natural science were responded
to with great promptitude and with a
clear knowledge of what they referred to.
The dog was the subject chosen for the lesson
on zoology. The answers to the questions
put on the variety of the species, and the
different characteristics that distinguished
them, were given with an exactness that
showed how well the subject had been explained
and understood. Scenes from Greek
mythology, orally taught, had been learnt by
heart, and were well retained by the pupils,
who are said to display great interest in the
classic selections, which they act in an admirable
manner; the piece chosen for recital in
our presence was a selection from the Iphigenia
in Tauris of Euripides.</p>

<p>In answer to our inquiries on the conduct
and natural disposition of his pupils, the
master said both were good, although not
free from faults, which he however felt confident
would in time be eradicated by proper
care and attention. When they first come
they are apt to be untruthful: a vice I suppose
they acquire, together with other bad
habits, in the streets, where they are unfortunately
allowed to associate with children
who have received no education. Very
much pleased with all I had seen and heard
in this establishment, I begged the director
to let me have one of the class-books containing
the routine of teaching. He replied that
he had no special work on the subject to
abide by, and that the routine of the lessons,
left to his own judgment, had been combined
by him partly from the system he had studied
in Germany, and partly from ideas suggested
to him by reading the philosophical works
of Herbert Spencer, for which he appeared
to have a great admiration.</p>

<p>Few subjects, I think, are more worthy of
attention than the march of progress among
nations which, perhaps from causes beyond
their own control, have long remained stationary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
I asked a Greek gentleman, a short
time since, what was the difference between
the present and the last generation; what
were the distinguishing characteristics of
each, and what the advantages of the actual
over the two preceding it. He replied that
the first was ignorant and despotic; fortune,
rather than merit, establishing the personal
influence of the individual. When this influence
was due to official favoritism, it was
seldom honestly acquired, and rarely beneficial
to others. The fortunes, too, if made in
the country, would not stand very close inspection,
for the system of money-making
in Turkey is of so elastic a nature that it has
to be pulled many ways, drawn and quartered,
before the honest capitalist can call the
money his own. The ladies of the past generation,
though good and matronly, had received
no education, and consequently could
not afford to their children the moral support
that the children of the present day are beginning
to enjoy. The mothers taught their
daughters to be pious and honest, and instructed
them in household management and
needlework, giving them at the same time a
very limited supply of elementary teaching;
any further education, up to a recent date,
was considered a superfluous accomplishment
for girls. The fathers had begun to
pay more attention to the education of their
sons, but this education was of a peculiar
character; some of these boys, when even
sent to foreign colleges to complete their
studies, on returning home, were allowed
neither the liberty of action nor the freedom
of thought that they were entitled to by their
superior education.</p>

<p>When these studies opened no particular
career to them, the youths were generally
called upon to follow the father’s trade or
profession in a monotonous routine often distasteful
to the more spirited young men, who
could not break through the restraint without
rebelling against the paternal authority.
This check often led to disobedience and desertion.
The independent youth would seek
elsewhere a calling more adapted to his
taste; many of these young men, starting
with no resources but their brains, have been
known to realize great fortunes. The rest
of them, married to wives generally chosen
for them by their parents, continue to live
docilely under the paternal roof, showing
every mark of deference to their father’s will,—the
absolute law of the house.</p>

<p>All that is now changed; the present generation
is far more active and free-thinking.
Those who have had the advantages of education
are no longer the dreaded despots of
their homes, but the companions of their
wives and the friends of their children, who,
thanks to the privileges they enjoy in this
respect, find their way to a free exchange of
ideas and feelings with their parents. Many
openings are now afforded to youths, who
are consulted on the subject, and are free to
follow the career they may choose. Should
this be commercial, they are no longer, as
formerly, the employés of their fathers, but
partners with them, sharing the responsibilities
and the profits of the business.</p>

<p>Good principles and morality are said to
have made great progress among the rising
generation, which in all respects is considered
by careful observers to be far superior to,
and promising to wipe away some of the
faults of, their ancestors in modern times.
Dishonesty is one of the evils generally attributed
to the Greek character. Considering
the long experience I have had of this
country, the close contact into which I have
been brought with all degrees of the Greek
community, I cannot in justice admit this
to be the rule. In my dealings with tradespeople,
I have never found them worse than
their neighbors belonging to other nationalities,
nor can I say that I have often detected
dishonesty in Greek servants, whilst to
their devotion and good services I owe much
of the comfort of a well-served house.</p>

<p>The nation of the Greeks is earnestly
taken up with remodelling itself through the
salutary means of education; it has made
great progress, and cannot fail to fit itself for
the prominent part it has to play in the destinies
of South-eastern Europe.</p>

<p>At no epoch of the history of the Bulgarians
does their dormant intellect appear to
have produced any works of art or genius.
This conclusion is arrived at by the absence
of any proof of an anterior Bulgarian civilization
in the form of literature or monuments.
Without personal traditions, they know
nothing of their past; and to learn something
of it, are forced to consult the Byzantine
and Slavonic authors. What civilization
they possessed was also borrowed from
the Slavs and Byzantines, with whom they
lived in close contact. In comparing the
national songs, their only literature, with
those of the above-mentioned nations, we are
led to conclude that the Bulgarians remained
equally impervious to the softer and more
elevating influence of the Greeks, and to the
warlike and independent spirit of the Servians
and other Slav populations, by whom
they were surrounded. Having imbibed
only to a slight extent the civilization of their
time, they must, after the Ottoman conquest,
through oppression and neglect, have
forgotten the little they once possessed, and
submitted to the life of perpetual toil and
hardship which they have for centuries endured.</p>

<p>These peacefully disposed and hard-working
peasants, however, though devoid of
learning, deprived of national history, and
cut off from the means of improvement, lack
neither intelligence, perseverance, nor desire
for instruction. We find the indications of
this tendency in some of their somewhat disconnected
and often uncouth national songs
and ballads, which breathe a true love of
country life, and illustrate the slow progress
of their art, by eulogizing the slight innovations
in their agricultural implements. Many
of their ballads set forth the brave deeds of
their few heroes, illustrate the past glory of
their kingdom, lament its downfall, or endeavor
to account for its misfortunes.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>These timid utterances of an undeveloped
people are simple narratives of past incidents,
whose relation is heightened neither by
the spirit of revenge for wrongs, nor yet by
hope for a brighter future. These, the only
heritage of their ancestors, the Bulgarians
treasure in their hearts, and at moments of
joy and exhilaration or suffering, chant
them to the accompaniment of the <i>guzla</i>, an
instrument of three chords, whose monotonous
sounds harmonize well with the shrill or
plaintive airs in which utterance is given to
their sentiments.</p>

<p>The blow aimed at the Bulgarian Church a
little more than a century ago fell with equal
weight upon the schools, which, though
neither numerous nor effective, were nevertheless
most valuable to the people, as the
last depositories of their national tongue.
These establishments, though the use of the
Bulgarian language was formally abolished
in them by the Greek Patriarch, still remained
scattered all over Bulgaria, and, directed
by the priests, enabled the Bulgarians,
during the revival of the Church question, to
make use of them as foundations for the
more important and solid erections that have
subsequently risen over them. The sudden
manifestation of a desire for instruction and
national improvement in Bulgaria is one of
the most extraordinary phenomena I have
had occasion to notice in the East.</p>

<p>Education at the time of the commencement
of this movement was a privilege possessed
by the very small section of the nation
who were able to seek it in foreign
countries. The townspeople studied but little,
and the teaching in their schools comprised
the Greek language, together with a
few general notions: while the bulk of the
population in the rural districts were left in
entire ignorance. Those who wished for
a more complete education, without leaving
their country, had recourse to the higher
Greek schools, in spite of the antipathy that
existed between the two races.</p>

<p>I had written to a Bulgarian gentleman requesting
some information upon the state of
education in his country, but, unfortunately,
the time at which I made this request did
not allow him to meet my demand, and his
daughter, a clever and accomplished young
lady, undertook the task instead. The following
is part of her first letter on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Chère Madame</span>: Mon père m’a dit
que vous désiriez avoir quelques renseignements
relativement à l’instruction en Bulgarie:
une statistique des écoles, je crois.
Comme il est très-occupé dans ce moment,
il m’a chargé de vous fournir le
peu de renseignements que nous possédons
à ce sujet. J’ai donc recueilli tout ce qui
a été publié jusqu’à présent par rapport
aux écoles; mais malheureusement tout
cela n’est que fort incomplet. Je me suis
donc adressée aux evêques, espérant obtenir
d’eux des informations plus exactes, et surtout
plus complètes, et quelques uns d’eux
m’ont promis de m’envoyer des statistiques
des écoles dans leurs éparchies. Quant à
l’origine de ce mouvement de la nation Bulgare
vers la lumière, on n’en sait pas grand’chose.
Tout ce que je pourrais vous dire à
ce sujet n’est que les premières manifestations,
faisant présager le reveil de cette nation
à la vie, datent du commencement de ce
siècle. Déjà en 1806 apparait le premier livre
publié en langue Bulgare; l’année 1819 on
voit paraître deux autres, et depuis ce temps
chaque année apporte son contingent, quoique
bien maigre encore, à ce petit trésor, qui
s’amasse goutte à goutte. Quel rêve avait fait
tressaillir ce peuple dans cette torpeur où il
était plongé et qui avait toutes les apparences
d’une léthargie devant durer éternellement?
Etait-ce un souvenir instantané du passé? Une
espérance subite d’un avenir moins sombre?
Car, l’époque est assez loin encore où cette
agglomeration de peuples, dont il fait partie,
va venir en contact avec l’Europe civilisée et
en subir l’influence. Quelque intéressante
que serait l’explication de ce phénomène, on
est obligé néanmoins de se contenter de conjectures.
La tâche de l’historien qui essayerait
d’élaircir ce point est tout aussi difficile
que celle du philosophe qui cherche à de décrire
le travail operé dans l’âme de l’enfant
avançant progressivement à la lumière des
nouvelles notions. Dans tous les deux cas,
l’individu, dans lequel s’opére ce travail et
qui pourtant est le plus à même d’en observer
la marche, est, par sa faiblesse même,
incapable d’en juger; il subit passivement,
et c’est tout. Cependant cette période si obscure
de notre vie nationale nous a légué
trois noms bien brillants. Je veux parler
du père Paisiy, qui, vers la fin du dernier
siècle écrivait une histoire de la Bulgarie et
quelques autres ouvrages; de Stoiko Vladislavoff
(1739-1815), plus tard connu sous le
nom de Sofraniy, qui écrivit près d’une vingtaine
d’ouvrages dont quelques uns n’existent
plus; et enfin de Néophite Bogvely, dont
un des ouvrages, intitulé ‘Mati Bolgaria’
(Mère Bulgarie), est d’une actualité si frappante
qu’on le croirait écrit hier. C’est un
dialogue entre une mère et son fils dans lequel
ils déplorent l’état de la patrie et recherchent
les causes de ses malheurs. La mère se
demande comment, malgré les immunités accordées
aux Chrétiens et la promulgation de
tant de bonnes lois, le sort de ces derniers ne
se trouve pas amélioré; alors le fils la fait
attention à la manière dont les lois sont appliquées.
On ne parlerait pas autrement aujourd’hui!
Observons en outre que tous les<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
trois parlent du joug phanariote comme d’une
des principales causes des malheurs de la
Bulgarie. Ceci montre que reveil de l’esprit
national chez les Bulgares n’est point, comme
quelques uns aiment à le faire croire, un
mouvèment factice dû à quelques individus.
C’est dans l’histoire de ces trois hommes, qui,
dans des circonstances plus favorables auraient
infailliblement été de veritables flambeaux
pour leur nation et peut-être pour l’humanité—c’est
dans leur histoire, dis-je, qu’il
faudrait chercher une partie des causes de la
régénération de la nation Bulgare.</p>

<p>“Vous voudriez savoir l’époque à laquelle
la première école fut fondée en Bulgarie. Il
semble que de tout temps de petites aient existé
où le prêtre enseignait aux enfants à lui,
et où la limite suprême de la science était atteinte
quand on parvenait à griffoner son
nom. Mais la première école un peu plus
digne de ce nom a été fondée à Gabrova vers
l’an 1835. Kopriochtitza, Kalofer, Bazardjik,
Sopote, suivirent bientôt cet exemple.
La première école Bulgare à Philippopolis
fut fondée en 1867. Je pourrais vous envoyer
avec les statistiques les programmes de
quelques unes des principales écoles....”</p>

</div>

<p>I regret to say that subsequent events unfortunately
prevented my obtaining all the
hoped-for information on this subject. I can
therefore only present an incomplete description
of the work of education in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>The schools opened at Gabrova, Kalofer,
Sapote, and subsequently at Philippopolis,
were the precursors of those that by degrees
spread in all directions, entering every nook
where a Bulgarian settlement existed; ten
years were sufficient to augment the small
number of original establishments to the following
number that existed in Bulgaria previously
to the desolation that befell that unfortunate
country.</p>

<p>In the province of Philippopolis there were
305 primary schools, 15 superior schools,
with 356 teachers and 12,400 scholars; 27
girls’ schools, with 37 teachers and 2265 pupils.
The Tuna vilayet, equally endowed,
was also in a fair way of improvement, and
the Bulgarian youth there, though less advanced
than in the district of Philippopolis,
were beginning to rival their brethren on the
other side of the Balkans.</p>

<p>The lessons taught in the gymnasium at
Philippopolis comprise the Turkish, Greek,
and French languages, elementary mathematics,
geography, Bulgarian and Turkish history,
mental and moral philosophy, religious
and moral instruction, and church music.</p>

<p>All these larger establishments, most of
which I visited, were fine spacious edifices;
some of them were formerly large old mansions,
others were specially erected for
schools.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1860 the schools in Bulgaria
owed their creation and maintenance to voluntary
subscriptions and to funds bequeathed
by charitable individuals. But these funds
were small compared with the demand made
by the people for the extension and development
of their educational institutions. At
the separation of their Church from that of
Constantinople, they reappropriated the revenues,
which were placed under the direction
of a number of men chosen from each district,
and a part of them was set aside for the
purposes of education. These first steps towards
a systematic organization of the Church
and schools were followed by the appointment
of a mixed commission of clerical and lay
members, annually elected in each district,
charged with the immediate direction of the
local ecclesiastical department. Each commission
acts separately and independently of
the other, but is answerable to the community
at large for the supervision and advancement
of public instruction. A further innovation
in the shape of supplying funds for the increasing
demand for schools of a higher class
was made by the Bulgarians of Philippopolis
by contriving to persuade the authorities of
that place to allow a tax to be levied on each
male Bulgarian of 52 paras (about 2½<i>d.</i>), by
means of which they are enabled to improve
and maintain their excellent <i>gymnasium</i>.
When I visited these establishments, most of
them were in their infancy. Bulgarian fathers,
with genuine pride and joy, gladly led
their sons to the new national schools, telling
them to become good men, remain devoted
to their nation, and pray for the Sultan. Exaggerated
and unnatural as this feeling may
appear in the face of late events, it was nevertheless
genuine among the Bulgarians in
those days. Russian influence had not made
itself felt at that time, nor were the intellects
of the poor ignorant Bulgarians sufficiently
developed to enable them to entertain revolutionary
notions or plot in the dark to raise
the standard of rebellion. Entirely absorbed
at that moment in the idea of obtaining the
independence of their Church and promoting
education, they were grateful to their masters
for the liberty allowed them to do more
than they had presumed to expect.</p>

<p>During the reign of Sultan Abdul-Aziz the
sentiment of loyalty of the subject races towards
their ruler diverged into two widely
distinct paths. Among the Bulgarians this
devotion originated in the intense ignorance
and debasement to which centuries of bondage
had reduced them: with the Greeks,
after the creation of free Hellas, there existed
a well-grounded confidence in themselves,
a clear insight into the future, and the patience
to keep quiet and wait for their opportunity.
The Bulgarians were loyal because
they knew no better; the Greeks because
their time was not yet come. They knew
the truth, “Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre.”
If the minds of the Bulgarians
subsequently became more alive to their actual
situation and they listened to revolutionary
suggestions, it was due to the teaching
they had obtained from their schools and
from the national ideas instilled into their
minds by the priests and schoolmasters.
This teaching was not always derived from
books, for these were rare and precious objects
not easy to obtain. Moreover, the difference
between the written and spoken language
is so great that the former can scarcely
be understood by the bulk of the population.
The original Hunnish tongue, absorbed
by the Slavonic dialect that succeeded
it, has preserved but little of the primitive
unwritten idiom; and even the adopted one
that replaced it gradually took in so great a
number of Turkish, Greek, Servian, and other
foreign words as to make the Bulgarian vernacular
scarcely analogous with the more
polished language now taught in the schools.
Even in Philippopolis some years ago the
Bulgarian ladies had great difficulty in understanding
the conversation of the ladies belonging
to the American mission, who had
learnt the written language and spoke it with
great purity. The modern Bulgarian is
based upon the Slav, and although differing
considerably from the Russian Slav language,
the two nations have no great difficulty,
after a little practice, in comprehending
each other. No less than seven Bulgarian
grammars are in existence, all written
during the last fifteen years; but they agree
neither in the general principles nor in the
details. Some entirely disregard the popular
idiom, and impose the rules of modern Russian
or Servian on the language. Others attempt
to reduce to rules the vernacular,
which is variable, vague, and imperfect.</p>

<p>The schoolmasters are, generally speaking,
young, ardent, and enthusiastic; if educated
abroad, they are fully versed in all the usual
branches of study, earnest in their work, as
if pressed forwards by the impetus of their
desire for inculcating into the minds of their
ignorant but by no means unintelligent brethren
all the views and sentiments that engross
their own. The priests of the towns and villages
become their confidants and co-workers;
and thus the two bodies that had obtained
self-existence at the same time, and
had the same object in view, served later on
as organs for instilling into the people some
notions of personal independence and the
wish for national liberty.</p>

<p>As a rule the Bulgarian is neither bright
nor intelligent in appearance. His timid
look, reserved and awkward manner, and his
obstinate doggedness when he cannot or will
not understand, give the peasant an air of
impenetrability often amounting to brute
stupidity. But those who have well studied
the capacity and disposition of the Bulgarian
consider this due rather to an incapability of
comprehending at the first glance the object
or subject presented to his attention, and a
dogged obstinacy that will not allow him to
yield readily to the proofs offered him.</p>

<p>This defect is so prominent in the Bulgarians
that they have received from the Greeks
the cognomen of χονδροκεφάλους (thick-heads),
and a Turk, wishing to denote a person
of an obstinate character, will use the expression
of “Bulgar Kaphalu,” while the
Bulgarian himself makes a joke of it, and,
striking his head, or that of his neighbor,
exclaims, “Bulgarski glava” (Bulgarian
head). These heads, however, when put to
the proof, by their capacity for study, their
patience, and perseverance, gain complete
mastery of the subject they interest themselves
in, giving evidence of intelligence,
which requires only time and opportunity to
develop into maturity.</p>

<p>The rivalry between this nation and the
Greeks is also doing much to promote education.
But another and more friendly and
effective stimulant exists in the untiring
efforts of the American missionaries who
have chosen this promising field of labor.
Their civilizing influence has taken an unassuming
but well-rooted foundation in all the
places in which they have established themselves,
and gradually develops and makes
itself evident in more than one way. Indefatigable
in their work of promoting religious
enlightenment and education, these missionaries
went about in their respective districts,
preaching the Gospel and distributing
tracts and Bibles among the people, who, in
some places, received them gladly with kindness
and confidence, while in others they
were regarded with distrust. Frequently,
however, a stray sheep or two would be
found, in even the most ignorant and benighted
parts, willing to be led away from his
natural shepherd, ready to listen to and accept
the teaching that spoke to his better
feelings and his judgment. If wholesale
conversion to Protestantism (of which I am
no advocate, unless it be based upon real intellectual
progress and moral development)
does not follow, much good is done in promoting
a spirit of inquiry, which can be satisfied
by the cheap and excellent religious
books furnished by the Bible societies. The
purity and devotion that characterize the
lives of these worthy people, who abandon a
home in their own land to undertake a toilsome
occupation among an ignorant and
often hostile population, form another moral
argument which cannot fail in the end to tell
upon the people. Nor has their work of
charity amidst death, cold, and starvation,
after the massacres, often at the risk of their
own lives, tended to lessen the general esteem
and regard in which they are held by
all classes and creeds of the population by
which they are surrounded.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian student, whether in his
own national schools or in those of foreign
nations, is hard-working and steady; grave
and temperate by disposition, he seldom exposes
himself to correction or to the infliction
of punishment. The scarcity of teachers
was at first a great hindrance to the propagation
of knowledge; this difficulty was by
degrees removed by sending youths to study
in foreign countries, who, on their return,
fulfilled the functions of schoolmasters. In
former times Russia was a great resort for
these students, but lately, notwithstanding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
great facilities, financial and otherwise, afforded
them in that country, they now prefer
the schools of France and Germany, together
with the College of the American Mission at
Bebek, and the training schools that have
been lately established in the country, which
are now capable of supplying the teachers
necessary for the village schools. Recent
events have, to a great extent, disorganized
this excellent system: had it been allowed
ten years longer to work, a transformed Bulgarian
nation might have occupied the world’s
attention.</p>

<p>The girls’ schools, also formed by the active
American ladies, deserve our attention.
Their principal object is to bestow sound
Christian instruction upon the rising female
population, and their efforts have met with
deserved yet unexpected success, not only in
developing knowledge among their own people,
but in stimulating the Bulgarian communities
to display a greater interest in the
education of their daughters and found
schools of a similar character. These establishments
have produced a number of excellent
scholars, who have done honor to them
by their attainments and general good character.</p>

<p>The agents of the Roman Catholic Propaganda
have schools in the principal towns,
and are actively employed; but their efforts
are more particularly directed to proselytism
than to instruction, and their work has consequently
met with less success than that of
the Protestant missionaries.</p>

</div>

<p>There are few people so superstitious as
the people of Turkey. All nations have their
traditions and fancies, and we find educated
Englishmen who dislike walking under a ladder
on superstitious grounds; but in Turkey
every action, every ceremony, every relation,
is hedged round with fears and omens and
forebodings. Whatever happens to you is
the work of supernatural agencies, and can
only be remedied by the <i>nostrums</i> of some
disreputable hag or some equally suspicious
quack diviner. If you lose anything, it is
the evil eye of some kind friend that has
done it. If you look fixedly at anybody or
anything, it is you who are trying to cast the
evil eye. In short, nothing happens in Turkey
unsupernaturally: there is always some
spirit or magician or evil eye at the bottom
of it. And this belief is not confined to the
Turks: Greeks, Bulgarians, and even a good
many Franks, are equally superstitious. Nor
is this superstition, like the many harmless
customs still observed in England, a mere
luxury—an affectation: it is a matter of life
and death. Not a few young girls have died
from the belief that they were bewitched, or
from some other superstitious shock; not a
few homes have been made miserable by the
meddlesome prophecies of a suborned astrologist.</p>

<p>A great centre of superstition is Mount
Olympus. Since the gods deserted it the
popular imagination has peopled it with spirits
of every denomination, and Klephtic
legend has added to the host. The Greek
peasants have a superstitious horror of approaching
the ruined villages at the foot of
the mountain; making the sign of the cross,
they take a circuitous by-path sooner than
follow the deserted road that would lead
them past the desecrated church, the neglected
graveyards, the blackened ruins of the
cottages, now believed to be haunted by the
restless spirits of dead Klephts, who roam
about in the silence of night, bemoaning
their fate, and crying vengeance on the oppressors
of their race. It is only on the anniversary
of the patron saint of this deserted
region that the surviving inhabitants of these
once prosperous hamlets, bringing their descendants
and carrying the aged and infirm
as well as the youngest babes, set out on a
pilgrimage to these spots hallowed by unforgotten
wrongs, to pray for the souls of the
dead and offer <i>mnemosyné</i> to calm their
restless spirits; and to inculcate in their children
the sacred duty of vengeance on the tyrants
who inflicted upon their ancestors those
speechless injuries whose memory it is the
object of these pilgrimages to preserve fresh
and vengeful. The Turks, ever ready to accept
their neighbors’ superstitions, dread
these ruined villages no less than the Greeks.
Peopled, as he believes them, by Peris and
Edjinlis, no Turk will come near them, for
fear of coming under some malign influence.</p>

<p>The Klephtic legends are full of the most
terrible of all ghosts, the <i>Vrykolakas</i>, or vampire.
Many popular songs tell of this fearful
spectre, who is the spirit of some traitor or
other evil-doer who cannot be at peace in his
grave, but is ever haunting the scene of his
crime. One ghastly poem records the visit
of a traitorous Klepht chieftain, Thanásê
Vagía, as a vampire, to his widow. This
man had betrayed his comrades to Ali Pasha,
and their souls, heralded by the ghostly
Kukuvagia, or owl of ill-omen, come and
drag him from his grave and hurry him to
Gardiki, where his deed of treachery was
done. Suddenly they find the soul of the
tyrant Ali Pasha, and, forgotten in the rush,
Thanásê Vagía takes refuge with his widow.
The dialogue between them is full of dramatic
power; the horror of the wife at the
livid apparition that seeks to embrace her,
and the vampire’s terror in his miserable
doom, are vividly told. At last the spectre
is driven away by the touch of the cross,
which he uncovers on his wife’s bosom. It
is a striking poem, and brings home to one
the living reality of this horrible superstition
to the Greeks. As we have seen, they make
periodical visits to the graves of their dead to
discover whether the soul is at peace. If the
body is not fully decomposed at the end of
the year, they believe that their relation has
become a Vrykolakas, and use every means
to lay the spirit.</p>

<p>But the Vrykolakas, though the most
ghastly of spirits, is not alone. There are
invisible influences everywhere in Turkey.
If the Vrykolakas haunts the graveyards, old
Konaks have their <i>edjinlis</i>, fountains their
<i>peris</i>, public baths their peculiar genii.</p>

<p>All these imaginary beings, whose existence
is implicitly believed in, are expected to
be encountered by the persons upon whom
they may choose to cast their baneful or
good influence. Their dreaded hostility is
combated by the Christians by religious faith,
such as an earnest appeal to Christ and the
Virgin, by repeatedly crossing themselves in
the name of both, or by taking hold of any
sacred amulet they may have on their persons.
These amulets consist of small portions
of the “true cross” enshrined in crosses
of silver, a crucifix, or an image of the Virgin,
which, trustingly held and shown to
the apparitions, have the effect of rendering
them impotent and causing them to vanish.
The Turks have recourse to the repetition of
a certain form of prayer, and to their <i>muskas</i>
or amulets, in which they place as much
faith as the Christians do in theirs.</p>

<p>In 1872 the whole town of Adrianople was
put in commotion by the nightly apparition
of a spectre that showed itself at Kyik, a fine
elevated part of the town, inhabited both by
Christians and Mussulmans. This imaginary
being, believed to be a Vrykolakas, was represented
to me, by eye-witnesses of both
creeds, who swore they had seen it listening
about their houses in the twilight, as a long,
slim, ugly-looking figure, with a cadaverous
bearded face, clad in a winding-sheet; one
of those restless spirits, in fact, who, not being
allowed the privilege of peaceful decomposition
in their tombs, still haunt the homes
of the living, tapping at their doors, making
strange noises, and casting their evil influence
upon them. This comedy lasted a fortnight,
during which in vain did the Mussulman
<i>Hodjas</i> and the Christian priests endeavor,
by their prayers and incantations, to
free the people from their alarming visitor.
At last, it was rumored that the only human
being possessing the power of doing so was
a Turkish <i>Djindji</i>, or sorcerer, famous for his
power over evil spirits, who lived in a town
at some distance, but who could only be prevailed
upon to come by payment of seven
<i>liras</i> by the Kyik people. On the arrival of
this man at Adrianople the supposed spirit
disappeared. The belief of the inhabitants
in the existence of the vampire was too
deeply rooted to allow me to ascertain who
was the charlatan that had benefited by this
imposition on public credulity. I questioned
a Greek woman who had seen it. She
crossed herself, and said she would rather
dispense with talking on the subject. On
asking a Turk his opinion on the apparition,
he said, “It must have been the spirit of
some corrupt bribe-eating Kadi, forbidden
the repose due to the remains of an honest
man, and come back to trouble us with his
presence after he has lost the power of fleecing
us of our money!”</p>

<p>The spirits that have their abodes in mineral
baths are specially courted by the sick,
who are taken to the establishments and left
under the beneficent care of these beings.
The mineral bath of Kainadjah, near Broussa,
is a dark dungeon-like place, extremely
old, and much famed in the district for its
healing powers. Its waters, strongly impregnated
with sulphur, are boiling hot, rendering
the atmosphere of the bath intolerable
to any but the credulous, who, I suppose, support
it, by virtue of the faith they place in
the good to be derived from the trial. A
crippled Turkish woman was taken to this
bath at nightfall, with a written petition in
her hand to the genii, and, according to the
usual routine, was left alone in utter darkness
in the inner bath till morning. The
spirits of the place, if well disposed towards
her and pleased with the sacrifice promised
to them, would be expected to come in the
course of the night and attend upon her. A
copper bowl, left by the side of the patient,
and knocked against the marble slabs in case
assistance was required, was the only means
of communication between the patient and
her friends waiting outside.</p>

<p>This woman, for many years deprived of
the use of her legs, had been brought from a
distant part of the country. I had a chat
with her before she underwent the treatment.
She appeared fully sensible of the
dangers it presented, but at the same time
confident in the benefits expected to be derived,
which the bath-women represented to
her as being unfailing, owing to the supernatural
aid the spirits would be sure to
accord her. This cure, of a nature so exhausting
to the system, and so telling upon
the imagination, requires a great amount of
moral courage and no small degree of physical
strength to carry out.</p>

<p>This subject was one of deep interest to
me, and my first care next morning was to
visit the patient, and see what the waters,
not the <i>Peris</i>, had done for her. I found her
sitting in the outer chamber of the bath, looking
very tired and exhausted; but, as I approached,
her face lighted with smiles, and
she actually stretched out her feet and attempted
to stand upon them. I could scarcely
believe my eyesight or conceal my surprise
at this sudden change in her condition. Her
friends cried out in chorus, “Spit upon
her, and say <i>Mashallah</i>!” while the bath-women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
ceased not to sound the praises and
boast of the power and good-will of the <i>Peris</i>
of their establishment who had wrought this
wonderful cure, leaving all the time no doubt
in my mind that the beneficent spirits were
no other than the <i>Hammamjis</i> themselves.</p>

<p>The following is the account the patient
gave of what she underwent when left alone
in her vapory dungeon:</p>

<p>“At first I felt a suffocating sensation, then
by degrees a weakness crept over me, my
eyes closed, and I fainted away. I do not
know how long I remained in that condition,
but on recovering consciousness I felt myself
handled by invisible beings, who silently
pulled and rubbed my afflicted limbs. My
terror at this stage was as great as my helplessness
to combat it. I began to tremble
and wished to call for help; when on the
point of doing so, I suddenly found myself
under the reviving influence of a pail of cold
water suddenly thrown over me. The shock,
together with my terror, was so great that I
actually made a supreme effort to stand upon
my feet, when, to my awe and astonishment,
I discovered that I had the power of doing
so; I even took a few steps forwards, but in
the darkness I could proceed no further, and,
finding my voice, began to call for help with
all my might. The gentle bang of the door
for a moment made me hope that my friends
were within reach; but no! it was only the
spirits, who, unwilling to be seen by mortal
eyes, were taking their departure. Their
exit was followed by the arrival of my
friends, who, alarmed by my screams, were
rushing to my aid. I was taken out by the
advice of the good <i>Hammamji Hanoum</i> (bath
mistress), and left to repose in the outer
chamber till morning. I have already ordered
the sacrifice of the sheep I promised to
the spirits, should they relieve me of the infliction
that has crippled me so many years,
and am willing to submit to the same ordeal
twice more, according to the recommendation
of the <i>Hammamji Hanoum</i>, in order to
afford the <i>Peris</i> the full time needed for the accomplishment
of their task.”</p>

<p>Cases of a similar nature have often been the
theme of wonder among those who frequented
the baths of Broussa, whose efficacious
waters used annually, and employed by civilized
patients who resort to them from all
parts of the Empire, are found salutary
enough without the services of the <i>Peris</i>.</p>

<p>Magic plays a great part in Turkish affairs.
Christians and Moslems, Greeks and Bulgarians,
Turks and Albanians, implicitly believe
in the power possessed by evil-minded
persons of casting spells upon their enemies
or rivals, and extraordinary means are resorted
to with a view to removing the baneful
influence. Among my Uskup reminiscences,
which are none of the most pleasant, I remember
one particularly interesting case,
which not only illustrates the general belief
of an ignorant population in the power of
spells, but also presents a fair picture of the
way the peasants are treated by their masters.
This instance of the rape of a Bulgarian
girl by a brigand chief is no isolated
case. Such things are the daily occupation
of Turks in authority and of Albanian chiefs
who have forgotten their national traditions
and have condescended to ape Turkish manners.</p>

<p>The heroine of my story was a young Bulgarian
girl belonging to the town of Uskup.
She was a strong healthy maiden, but not
the less beautiful:—a brunette, with bright
black eyes full of expression, a small, well-shaped
mouth, fine teeth, a forehead rather
low, but broad and determined, and a nose in
which high spirit and character were strongly
marked. Her oval face would have been
perfect but for the slight prominence of the
cheek-bones. Her jet-black hair fell in a
number of braids on her well-shaped shoulders,
in fine contrast to the rich embroidery
of her <i>Sutna</i>. On working days she was
seen laboring in the fields with her brothers,
where her cheerful voice would enliven the
monotonous sound of the spade; while on
feast-days she was ever the first to reach the
common and lead the <i>Hora</i> to the sound of
the <i>Gaida</i>. Her natural gayety made her
welcome everywhere; she was called “The
Lark” by her friends, and was the life and
soul of every gathering. She had the happy
assured look of the girl who loves well and is
loved well again.</p>

<p>One feast-day, riding by the common, I
reined in my horse, and stopped to admire
this pretty creature by the side of her handsome
and intelligent-looking lover, gracefully
leading the dance. They both looked pleased
and happy, as though their earthly Paradise
had as yet known no shadow. But the sun
that set so brightly on the festivities of the
day was darkened on the morrow. The poor
girl was going at dawn to the harvest field,
with her bright sickle in her hand, when
she was waylaid by a band of Albanian
ruffians, who suddenly appeared from behind
a hedge where they had been concealed, and
tried to seize and carry her off. The danger
was sudden, but the stout-hearted girl lost
neither courage nor presence of mind; holding
her sickle, she stood her ground, bravely
defended herself and kept her ravishers at
bay. The Albanians, who make it a point of
honor not to strike a woman, changed their
plan, and pointing their guns at her brothers,
who stood helpless by her side, shouted,
“Yield, Bulka, or both your brothers are
dead!” A look of despair flashed for a moment
across her face; then folding her arms
she declared her readiness to follow her persecutors,
saying, “You have power over my
person, take it, and do your worst; but what
is within here” (pointing to her head and
heart) “none shall have save the Great Bogha
and my Tashko.”</p>

<p>Mehemet Bey, a brigand chief, was the
instigator of the abduction. Assisted by two
subordinates, he placed her behind him on
his horse and galloped off across the plain of
the Vardar to his village. The brothers, dismayed
by the misfortune that had so unexpectedly
befallen their sister, ran back to the
town and gave notice to the venerable bishop,
who at once proceeded to the Konak and acquainted
the Kaimakam with the details, and
demanded that the girl should be reclaimed
and given up to him. The salutary custom
then practised in cases of both willing and
compulsory conversion was that the neophytes
should be placed under the keeping
of the bishop in the <i>Metropolis</i>, where they
were allowed to remain three days, enjoying
the benefits of religious advice and the good
influence of their friends. This excellent
custom, since done away, had the best
results. The prevailing custom, which has
superseded this, is to send the neophyte to
the house of the Kadi or governor of the
town, where a very different influence, seldom
of a salutary nature, is exerted during
three days, when the presumed convert, often
yielding to erroneous arguments and false
promises, is led before the Court to declare
his or her adoption of the Moslem faith.
This pressure was brought to bear upon
Rayna, our heroine, and she was treated by
the Albanian chief and his friends by turns
to threats of vengeance and every kind of
flattery and glittering promise. But the
brave girl was deaf to both, and by the instrumentality
of the Kaimakam the captive
was finally brought to the Metropolis, where
she strongly protested against the calumnious
accusations brought against her by her enemies
of having tacitly consented to her abduction,
and demanded to be led before the
Court without delay to make her final declaration.</p>

<p>Her captivity had naturally been a terrible
blow to her betrothed, and the joy of her release
was sadly darkened by horrible suspicions
of the dishonor to which she might
have been subjected. The young man accepted
all the same his chosen bride, whom
he had so narrowly escaped losing, and the
wedding-day was fixed.</p>

<p>The bridegroom’s home was so situated,
that from the windows of my room I could
see into it. The family consisted of an aged
Bulgarian woman and her son, a furrier by
trade. A week before the ceremony took
place, the old lady might be seen working
away at the preparations for the coming
event. The house was thoroughly cleaned
and whitewashed; the copper pots, pans, and
dishes, and the china and glass, indispensable
decorations of the shelves that adorn the
walls of every well-to-do Bulgarian tradesman’s
house, were in their turn brought
down, made bright and shining, and then returned
to their places. All the carpets were
then produced, in extraordinary quantity,
and of all colors, dimensions, and qualities.
These were stretched on mattresses, sofas, on
the floors of the rooms and on the veranda.
The cellar was next visited, and no small
quantity of its fluid contents brought forth.
Uskup is the only town in Turkey in which
I have noticed a tendency on the part of the
female population to indulge in drink; they
do not, however, practise this vice in public,
nor is an inebriated woman ever seen in the
country. Finally the provisions, consisting
of an abundant supply of flour, rice, butter,
honey, and fruits were collected, and all
seemed in readiness. The future bridegroom,
however, who appeared ill and dispirited,
took no very active part in the arrangements,
and I frequently observed him
sitting on the veranda silent and dull, smoking
cigarette after cigarette; his mother occasionally
whisking round and reprimanding
him in strong Bulgarian language, to which
he would sometimes respond by a few words
and at others would heave a deep sigh and
leave the house.</p>

<p>I went to see the bride on the day she was
brought to her new home. She looked very
pretty in her bright bridal costume, but her
fine eyes had lost something of their lustre
and her cheeks much of their wonted bloom.
She looked serious and concerned; her husband,
dull and dispirited. As they stood up
to make the first formal round of the dance,
I noticed the difference in their step,
formerly so light, now heavy and sorrowful.
As they turned round, slowly measuring
their steps to the music of the <i>gaida</i>, not a
smile parted their lips, not a cheerful word
was heard from the rest of the company.
The poor bride noticed this, and a few tears
dropped from her eyes; but her cup of sorrow
was not yet full. A suspicious-looking
woman, famous for her deep knowledge of
witchcraft, entered; taking aside the bridegroom,
she whispered something in his ear
which seemed to impress him deeply. This
bird of ill omen left behind her a chill which
all seemed to feel. When the week’s feasting
was at an end, the gossips began to chat
over the event, all agreeing that a duller wedding
had never taken place in their town,
and prophesying all sorts of misfortunes to
the young couple. I frequently saw them
from my windows, and noticed that they did
indeed seem far from happy. The husband
looked morose, was seldom at home, and
during those intervals was always in bad
humor and disputing with his mother, and
quarrelling with his wife, who was oftener
crying than laughing.</p>

<p>The gossiping tongues of the neighbors
were once more loosed, and the report was
spread that the bridegroom was laboring
under the influence of a magical spell cast
upon him by his disappointed rival, the Albanian
chieftain, and that he was consequently
<i>zaverza</i>. This spell cast upon men
is, among other devices, operated by means
of the locking of a padlock by a sorcerer,
who casts the lock into one well and the key
into another. This is supposed actually to
lock up every feeling and faculty of the individual
against whom it is directed, and to render
him insensible to the impressions of love.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
This spell, implicitly believed in and much
feared by all the ignorant people of the country,
requires the assistance of a professional
to remove its malignant effects. The unhappy
couple, after many miserable months,
resolved to have recourse to the sorceress
before mentioned, and after the husband had
undergone the remedies prescribed by her
everything went well, and my heroine once
again became happy. Such is the force of
imagination.</p>

<p>The antidotes employed in these cases
consist of quicksilver and other minerals,
placed with water in a basin, called the
<i>Meras Tas</i>, or Heritage-Bowl, a very rare vessel,
highly prized for its virtues, and engraved
with forty-one padlocks. The water
is poured from this bowl over the head of the
afflicted person during the seven weeks following
Easter. At Monastir, this ablutionary
performance is held in a ruined mill called
Egri Deirmen, where every Thursday during
this period may be seen a heterogeneous
gathering of Turks, Jews, Bulgarians, Wallachians,
Albanians, and Greeks, young and
old, male and female, who resort to the spot,
and for the modest payment of a copper coin
receive the benefits of an anti-magical wash.
Every one who has been to the place will attest
the beneficial effect of this rite, and so
deeply rooted is the belief in the influence of
magic in the minds of these people that even
those who may have wished to free themselves
from what they almost admit to be a
superstition, say that they are led back by
the incontrovertible evidence they see of its
effects on the persons against whom it is employed.</p>

<p>Most of the spells cast upon persons are
aimed at life, beauty, wealth, and the affections.
They are much dreaded, and the
events connected with this subject that daily
occur are often of a fatal character. A Turkish
lady, however high her position, invariably
attributes to the influence of magic the neglect
she experiences from her husband, or the
bestowal of his favor on other wives. Every
Hanoum I have known would go down to
the laundry regularly and rinse with her own
hands her husband’s clothes after the wash,
fearing that if any of her slaves performed
this duty she would have the power of casting
spells to supplant her in her husband’s
good graces. Worried and tormented by
these fears, she is never allowed the comfort
of enjoying in peace that conjugal happiness
which mutual confidence alone can give. A
<i>buyu boghcha</i> (or magic bundle) may at any
time be cast upon her, cooling her affection
for her husband, or turning his love away
from her. The blow may come from an envious
mother-in-law, a scheming rival, or
from the very slaves of whose services the
couple stand daily in need. A relative of
Sultan Abdul-Medjid assured me that on the
death of that gentle and harmless Padishah
no fewer than fifty <i>buyu boghchas</i> were found
hidden in the recesses of his sofa. All these
were cast upon the unfortunate sovereign by
the beauties who, appreciated for a short time
and then superseded by fresh favorites, tried
each to perpetuate her dominion over him.</p>

<p>During a conversation I recently had with a
Turkish lady of high position, who had spent
seventeen years of her life in the seraglio
of Sultan Abdul-Aziz, I happened to refer to
the eccentricities occasionally displayed by
that Sultan. She looked reproachfully at me
and exclaimed, “How can you accuse the
memory of our saintly master of eccentricity
when every one knows it was the effect of
magic?” and, adding action to her words,
she began to enumerate on the tips of her
fingers all the persons who had a special interest
in having recourse to this practice in
order to bewilder the mind of the Sultan.
“The first schemer,” said she, “is the
Validé Sultana, desirous of perpetuating her
influence over the mind of her son. The
next is the Grand Vizir, in the hope of further
ingratiating himself with his master.
Then comes the Kislar Aga, chief of the
eunuchs, with a host of women, all disputing
with each other the affection of the Sultan.
If ten out of twelve of these fail in their attempt
the machinations of two will be sure
to succeed, and these two suffice to bewilder
the mind of any man. When our lamented
master was driven out of his palace, and the
furniture removed from his chamber, <i>buyu
boghchas</i> were found even under the mats on
the floor. These, taken up by some good
women that still venerated his memory, were
thrown into the sea or consumed by fire.”</p>

<p>The <i>buyu boghcha</i> is composed of a number
of incongruous objects, such as human bones,
hair, charcoal, earth, besides a portion of the
intended victim’s garment, etc., tied up in a
rag. When it is aimed at the life of a person,
it is supposed to represent his heart, and
is studded with forty-one needles, intended
to act in a direct manner and finally cause
his death. Two of these bundles, of a less
destructive nature, were thrown into my
house; on another occasion two hedgehogs,
also considered instruments of magic and
forerunners of evil, were cast in. All these
dreaded machinations had, however, no other
effect on me beyond exciting my curiosity to
know their perpetrator; but they occasioned
great fear to my native servants, who were
continually expecting some fatal calamity to
happen in consequence.</p>

<p>The advice of magicians, fortune-tellers,
dream-expounders, and quack astrologers is
always consulted by persons desirous of being
enlightened upon any subject. Stolen
property is believed to be recoverable through
their instrumentality, and the same faith is
placed in them as a European victim of some
wrong would put in the intelligence and
experience of a clever detective. Some of
these individuals are extremely acute in arriving
at the right solution of the mystery.
Their power, dreaded by the suspected parties
as sure to result in some unforeseen
calamity, is a moral pressure which, when
set to work upon the superstitious, succeeds
beyond expectation. The following is an
example of the hold that superstition has
over the minds of the most enlightened
Turks. A Pasha, who had been ambassador
at Paris, and whose wit, liberal ideas, and
pleasant manners were highly appreciated in
European circles, was appointed in his more
mature years Governor-General of Broussa
during the reign of Abdul-Medjid. During
his travels he had collected a splendid library,
the finest ornament of his house.
These books gave umbrage to an old sheikh,
who possessed unlimited influence over the
Pasha. The old fanatic had mentally vowed
the destruction of these writings of the infidel,
and by means of his eloquence and by
prophetic promises he so worked upon the
governor’s superstitious feelings as to induce
him to sacrifice his library, which was
brought down into the court-yard and made
into a bonfire. The recompense for this act
of abnegation, according to the sheikh, was
to be the possession of the much-coveted post
of Grand Vizir. Strange to say, a short time
afterwards the Pasha was called to occupy
that position; but its glory and advantages
were enjoyed by him for the short period of
three days only—a poor recompense for his
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Belief in the evil eye is perhaps more deeply
rooted in the mind of the Turk than in that
of any other nation, though Christians, Jews,
and even some Franks regard it as a real
misfortune. It is supposed to be cast by
some envious or malicious person, and sickness,
death, and loss of beauty, affection, and
wealth are ascribed to it. Often when paying
visits of condolence to Turkish harems,
I have heard them attribute the loss they
have sustained to the <i>Nazar</i>. I knew a beautiful
girl, who was entirely blinded and disfigured
by small-pox, attribute her misfortune
to one of her rivals, who, envying in
her the charms she did not herself possess,
used to look at her with the peculiar <i>fena guz</i>
(bad expression) so much dreaded by Turkish
women. When the misfortune happened,
the ignorant mother, instead of reproaching
herself for her neglect in not having had her
daughter vaccinated, lamented her want of
foresight in having omitted to supply her
with the charms and amulets that would
have averted the calamity.</p>

<p>A lady who had lost a beautiful and valuable
ring that had attracted the attention of
an envious acquaintance, when relating to
me the circumstance with great pathos, attributed
her loss solely to the evil eye cast
upon it by her friend.</p>

<p>I knew a lady at Broussa whose eye was so
dreaded as to induce her friends to fumigate
their houses after she had paid them a visit.
She happened to call upon my mother one
evening when we were sitting under a splendid
weeping willow-tree in the garden. She
looked up and observed that she had never
seen a finer tree of its kind. My old nurse
standing by heard her observation, and no
sooner had our visitor departed than she
suggested that some garlic should at once be
hung upon it or it would surely come to grief.
We all naturally ridiculed the idea, but, as
chance would have it, that very night a storm
uprooted the willow. After this catastrophe
the old woman took to hanging garlic everywhere,
and would have ornamented me with
it had I not rebelled.</p>

<p>At Uskup the finest horse in the town was
my Arab, which was said to excite the admiration
and envy of the Albanians, whose
love for fine horses is well known. Often
after having been out he was pronounced
<i>Nazarlu</i> by our faithful kavass and the groom,
and was at once taken to a sheikh of great
repute in the town, who read prayers over it,
pulled its ears, and after breaking an egg on
its forehead, sent it back with every assurance
that it was <i>Savmash</i> (cured). Finding
that my pet was none the worse for this
strange treatment (for which I was never
allowed to pay by my excellent friend the
old sheikh), and seeing that it afforded gratification
to my people, I allowed them to take
it as often as they liked.</p>

<p>Visiting one day the nursery of a friend,
we found the baby, six months old, divested
of its clothing and stretched on a square of
red cloth, while the old Greek nurse, much
concerned about the ailing condition of her
charge, which she attributed to the effects of
the evil eye, was presiding over the following
operation performed by an old hag of the
same nation in order to free the infant from
the supposed influence. Little heaps of
hemp, occupying the four corners of the
cloth, were smoking like miniature altars;
their fumes, mingling with the breathings
and incantations of the old enchantress,
offered a strange contrast to the repeated
signs of the cross made by her on the baby’s
body, ending in a series of gymnastic contortions
of its limbs. The child soon recovered
his wonted liveliness, and seemed to enjoy
the process, crowing and smiling all the time.</p>

<p>Should you happen to fix your gaze on a
person or object in the presence of ill-disposed
Turks, you are liable to receive rude remarks
from them under the idea that you are casting
the evil eye. Some months ago two
Turkish boys, belonging to one of the principal
families of the town of R⸺, attracted
the attention of some Christian children who
stood by, and who were forthwith violently
assaulted by the servants of the little boys,
who called out, “You little giaours! how
dare you look in this manner at our young
masters and give them the evil eye?” The
cries of the children brought some shopkeepers
to the spot, who with some difficulty
rescued them from this unprovoked attack.</p>

<p>The preservatives employed against the
power of this evil are as numerous as the
means used to dissipate its effects. The
principal preventives and antidotes are garlic,
cheriot, wild thyme, boar’s tusks, hares’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
heads, terebinth, alum, blue glass, turquoise,
pearls, the bloodstone, carnelian, eggs (principally
those of the ostrich), a gland extracted
from the neck of the ass, written amulets,
and a thousand other objects. The upper
classes of the Christians try to avert its effect
by sprinkling the afflicted persons with holy
water, fumigating them with the burning
branches of the palms used on Palm Sunday,
and by hanging amulets round their necks:
as preservatives, coral, blue glass ornaments,
and crosses are worn. The common people
of all denominations resort to other means in
addition to these. The Bulgarians, for instance,
take six grains of salt, place them on
each eye of the afflicted person, and then cast
them into the fire with a malediction against
the person supposed to have caused the evil.
They also take three pieces of burning charcoal,
place them in a green dish, and making
the sign of the cross pour water over them.
Part of this liquid is drunk by the victim,
who also washes his face and hands in it and
then throws the remainder on the ground
outside the house.</p>

<p>On the last day of February (old style), they
take the heads of forty small fish, and string
and hang them up to dry. When a child is
found ailing from the supposed effects of the
evil eye, the heads are soaked in water, and
the horrible liquid given to it to drink. It is
considered a good test of the presence of the
evil eye to place cloves on burning coals and
carry them round the room. Should many
of these explode, some malicious person is
supposed to have left the mischievous effects
of the <i>Nazar</i> behind him.</p>

<p>Blue or gray eyes are more dreaded than
dark ones, and red-haired persons are particularly
suspected. Great circumspection is
observed in expressing approbation, admiration
or praise, of anything or anybody, as all
Orientals live in a continual state of dread of
the effects of the <i>fena guz</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the belief in spirits, magic, and
other supernatural powers, public credulity
in the East is apt to accept as facts a variety
of matters not less absurd and often more
injurious. In spring, for instance, a popular
idea prevails that blood in some manner or
other must be drawn from the body in order to
cool the system and render it healthy for the
summer. Part of the population will appeal
to the barber, part to professed phlebotomists,
others to the application of leeches. Superstition
requires that vipers should be medicinally
used in spring; the gypsies undertake to
collect these and sell them alive to the inhabitants
of towns. I remember seeing one
of these reptile-hunters carry a bagful of
them on his back against a sheepskin-coat.
A passer-by being attracted by their movements,
visible through the bag, took hold of
it, but no sooner had he done so than he paid
dearly for his curiosity by being severely
bitten by one of them. Freshly killed animals,
such as frogs, birds, etc., are often applied
to suffering members of the body.</p>

<p>Croup is cured by amulets procured from
the Hodjas and hung round the neck of the
child. Turkish women have often assured
me that this remedy is never known to fail,
and consequently they resort to no other.
Square pieces of paper, bearing written inscriptions,
are given for a few piastres by
learned Hodjas to persons whose dwellings
are infested with vermin. These are nailed
on the four walls of an apartment, and are
believed to have the power of clearing it of
its obnoxious tenants. Going into the room
of one of my servants one day at Adrianople,
I found a cucumber-boat occupying each
corner. On inquiring why they were placed
there, an old servant answered that, being
inconvenienced by the too plentiful visitation
of vermin, she had appealed to a person at
Kyik, whose magical influence, conveyed in
cucumbers, was stated to be infallible in driving
the creatures away. I tried to analyze
the contents of these receptacles, but finding
them a mess composed of charcoal, bones,
bits of written paper, hair, etc., I soon desisted,
hoping that it would prove more
efficacious than it promised.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian remedy for this pest, although
simpler in form, can hardly be more
effective. It consists of a few of these insects
being caught on the 1st of March, inclosed in
a reed, and taken to the butcher, their credentials
being couched in the following
terms: “Here is flesh, here is blood for
you to deal with; take them away and give
us something better in exchange.”</p>

<p>Another means of getting rid of serpents,
venomous insects, and vermin, is made use of
by the Bulgarians on the last day of February;
it consists in beating copper pans all
over the houses, calling out at the same time,
“Out with you, serpents, scorpions, fleas,
bugs, and flies!” A pan held by a pair of
tongs is put outside in the court-yard.</p>

<p>Mohammedans execrate the Christian faith,
and Christians the Mohammedan faith, but
both in cases of incurable diseases have recourse
reciprocally to each other’s Ἁγιάσματα
(holy wells), the sacred tombs of the saints,
and to the prayers of the clergy of both
creeds. I have often seen sick Turkish children
taken to the Armenian church at
Broussa, and heard prayers read over them
by Armenian priests. I have also seen Christian
children taken to Hodjas to be blown
and spat upon, or have the visitation of intermittent
fever tied up by means of a piece
of cotton-thread twisted round the wrist.</p>

<p>I happened one day to be making some
purchases from a Jew pedler at the gate,
when a Turkish woman passing by came
quietly up to the old man, and before he
could prevent her, made a snatch at his beard
and pulled out a handful. The unfortunate
Hebrew, smarting under the pain and insult,
asked the reason for her cruelty. “Oh,” she
answered, “I did not intend to insult or hurt
you; but my daughter has had fever for a
long time, and as all remedies that I have
tried have proved vain, I was assured that
some hairs snatched from the beard of an
Israelite and used to fumigate her with would
be sure to cure her.” She then tied up her
stolen treasure in her handkerchief and
walked away with it.</p>

<p>Dreams play a great part in Eastern life.
The young girl, early taught to believe in
them, hopes to perceive in these transient
visions a glimpse of the realities that are
awaiting her; the married woman seeks, in
their shadowy illusions, the promise of the
continuation of the poetry of life, and firmly
believes in the coming realities they are supposed
to foreshadow; while the ambitious
man tries to expound them in favor of his
hopes and prospects, often guiding his actions
by some indistinct suggestion they convey
to his mind. When a Greek woman has
had a remarkable dream, she will consult
her Ὄνειρο, or book of dreams, the Bulgarian
will gossip over it with her neighbors, often
accepting their interpretation, and the Turkish
woman will do the same, but if not satisfied
with the explanations given, she has
the alternative of consulting the Hodja, who
will find a better meaning in his “learned
books.”</p>

<p>A projected contract of marriage is often
arrested by the unfavorable interpretation of
a dream, or a marriage that had not previously
been imagined is entered into under
the same influence. The vocations of a man
may be changed by a dream, and the destinies
of a family trusted to its guidance.
Dreams are often used as a medium of discovering
truth, and are efficacious instruments
in the hands of those who know how
to use them. A Turkish servant was suspected
by one of my friends of having stolen
a sum of money which she missed from her
safe. The lady called in the woman and said
to her, “Nasibeh, I dreamed last night that
while I was out the other day you walked
into my room and took the money that was
there.” The culprit, taken by surprise, exclaimed,
with too much earnestness, “I did
not take it!” My friend responded, “I have
not accused you of having taken it, but since
you deny it so earnestly you are open to suspicion.
If the money is not there you must
have taken it.” After a little pressure the
woman confessed that, tempted by the
<i>Sheytan</i>, she had done so, but that she would
give it back, promising to be honest for the
future. She was retained in her situation,
and, be it said to her credit, was never again
found guilty.</p>

<p>The most trivial circumstances connected
with the birth of a child are considered of
good or bad omen according to the interpretation
given to them. Trifling accidents
happening on a wedding-day have also their
signification; so have the breaking of a looking-glass,
the accidental spilling of oil, sweeping
the house after the master has left it to
go on a journey, the meeting of a funeral or
of a priest, a hare crossing the path, and a
thousand other every-day occurrences. The
Turks, after cutting their nails, will never
throw away the parings, but carefully keep
them in cracks of the walls or the boards,
where they are not likely to be scattered
about. This is based on the idea that at the
resurrection day they will be needed for the
formation of new ones.</p>

<p>Sultan Mahmoud, the grandfather of the
present Sultan, was in his bath when the
news of the birth of his son Abdul-Aziz was
announced to him. The tidings are said to
have made him look sad and thoughtful; he
heaved a deep sigh, and expressed his regret
at having been informed of the event when
divested of his clothing, saying it was a bad
omen, and his son was likely to leave his
people as naked as the news of his birth had
found his father. Unfortunately for the
nation, this prediction was but too exactly
realized.</p>

<p>Predictions have great influence over the
Mohammedan mind. On the eve of great
battles, or on the occasion of any great political
change, prophecies are consulted and
astrologers appealed to, to prognosticate the
issue of the coming event. Many of these
individuals have paid with their heads for
the non-fulfilment of their prophecies.</p>

<p>The last prediction in circulation at Stamboul,
uttered since the death of Sultan Abdul-Aziz,
says that seven sultans must succeed
each other, most of them dying violent
deaths, before the Empire will be secure.</p>

<p>While living at a farm near Broussa, situated
a few miles from the town, not far from
the ruins of a fine old hostelry called the
“Bloody Khan,” my mother was one moonlight
night accosted by an old Turk while we
were out walking. He was a stranger in
the place, tall and handsome, with a snowy
beard falling upon his slightly bent chest. A
peculiar, restless look about the eyes, and the
numerous scars that covered his bare breast
and face were evident indications that whatever
his present calling might be, his past
life must have been a stormy and adventurous
one. He walked quietly towards us,
and stopping before my mother, with a certain
amount of respect mingled with paternal
familiarity, said to her, “<i>Kuzim, gel!</i>
(Daughter, come!) I have a secret to reveal
to you.” My mother followed him, and half
amused and wholly incredulous listened
to the following recital. Pointing to the
“Bloody Khan,” which, being situated upon
the principal road leading into the interior,
had once been occupied by a band of forty
robbers, he said, “I was the chief of the
band of brigands that occupied that Khan.
You must know its story. Forty years have
passed during which my faithful followers
have been caught, killed, or dispersed, leaving
me the sole representative of the band.
A timely repentance of my evil ways led me
to make a <i>Tubé</i> vow and renounce the old
trade. I have since lived in peace with Allah
and with men. I have sworn to lay violent
hands on no man’s property more; but my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
conscience does not rebel against attempting
to recover what I had buried beneath yonder
wall. I want your powerful concurrence to
dig out this buried treasure, the greater part
of which will be yours.” My mother naturally
refused to have anything to do with the
affair. Seeing her unwillingness, the old man
tried all his powers of persuasion to induce
her to take part in his plan, saying, “On me,
my daughter, be the sin. I will rest content
with a small portion of what will be recovered,
all the rest I abandon to you!” Finding
this last inducement had no more effect
than his previous promises, he turned away,
saying, “Since you refuse I must seek somebody
else.” Among the few Mohammedan
inhabitants of the small village his choice
fell upon the <i>Imam</i>, whose enterprising face
promised the old man better success. The
cunning Imam, on hearing the brigand’s tale,
being persuaded of its veracity, at once
promised his assistance, mentally deciding,
however, that he would be the only one to
profit by the hidden treasure. He at once
began to make use of the usual stratagem of
superstition, which could alone secure the
success of his plan. Telling the old man
that according to his books ill-gained wealth
must be in the possession of evil spirits, and
that in order to guard themselves against
their influences during their digging enterprise,
and to prevent the treasure from turning
into charcoal, a peculiar process of appeasing
and soothing incantations would be
needed; but that he would at once proceed
to perform these, and at the first crowing of
the cock all would be ready, and they would
proceed together to the spot and unearth the
treasure. The credulous old chief stroked
his beard, and said that with Allah’s help and
the good-will of the <i>Peris</i> by the next day
they would be rich men. In the course of
the night, as arranged, the two, spade in
hand, leading the Imam’s horse bearing saddle
bags, proceeded to the spot. The Imam
commenced operations by surrounding himself
and his companion with as many magical
observances as he could invent. Telling
him to remove the first spadeful of earth,
they went on digging alternately until a hollow
sound told the sharp ear of the Imam
that the distance between them and the coveted
wealth was not great. He threw down
his spade, and again resorting to magical
mummeries declared that the danger was
imminent, as the spell foretold resistance on
the part of the spirits, and a refusal to yield
possession unless a goat were at once sacrificed
to them. “Go,” said he, earnestly,
“back to the mosque, and in the small chamber
you will find three goats; take the milk-white
one and bring it here. Do not hurry
it much, but lead it gently, as becomes the
virtue of the offering.” The old man, nothing
doubting, with Turkish nonchalance
went quietly back to the village, which lay
about three miles distant. The Imam once
rid of him, and when in no danger of being
seen or heard, set actively to work, got out
the treasure, placed it in his saddle-bags,
mounted, and rode off, and was never seen
or heard of in the village again. The old
man returned in due time, accompanied by
the goat, to find nothing but his spades, the
pile of earth, and the gaping hole. Disgusted,
disappointed, and enraged, he came
back to the village, and early next morning
made his appearance at the farm. Inquiring
for my mother, he acquainted her with the
pitiable results of his attempt. This time the
curiosity of the whole family was roused, and
we all proceeded in a body to the spot. The
old man’s assertions proved to be perfectly
correct, and my brother, upsetting part of the
upturned earth, discovered a handsome silver
dish and cup, which we took home with us
as trophies of the strange adventure.</p>

<p>The following strange incident happened
at Broussa when I was a child. Incredible
as it may appear, its authenticity cannot be
disputed, and a statement of the fact may
be found in the Consular Reports made at the
time to the Foreign Office:</p>

<p>The monotonous life of the inhabitants of
this romantic old city, which a French
<i>improvisateur</i> justly designated as <i>un tombeau
couvert de roses</i>, was one morning startled by
the arrival of a band of fifty or sixty wild-looking
people—men, women, and a few
children. None knew whence they came or
what they wanted. Some of them, dressed
as Fakirs, spoke bad Turkish; the rest used
a guttural dialect unintelligible to any but
themselves. Their costume, composed of a
sheet or wrapper, left their arms, legs, and
tattooed breasts bare; white turbans, from
under which a quantity of matted hair hung,
covered the heads of the men. The women,
whose arms and breasts were bare, wore
brass and bead ornaments, large rings in their
ears, and a sheet over their heads. They
were fine, strongly-built people, with regular
features and bronzed skins. This nomad
band, which was conjectured to have come
from some distant part of Central Asia, took
up its quarters at Bournabashi, a beautiful
spot outside the walls of the town, where a
grove of cypress trees shelter a fine mausoleum
containing the saintly remains of one
of the first chieftains who accompanied Sultan
Orkhan and settled in the city after the
conquest. His shrine, much venerated by
the Mohammedans, is a resort for pilgrims,
who may often be seen performing their ablutions
at the cool fountains by the side of
the vale, or devoutly bending to say their
<i>namaz</i> under the shade of the imposing trees,
having lighted tapers on the tomb.</p>

<p>It must have been some mysterious legend
connected with the life and deeds of this reputed
saint, mixed up, as most Oriental legends
are, with the supernatural, that, finding
its way back to his native land, and discovered
or expounded centuries later by his savage
kindred, led them to undertake this long
journey and do homage at the tomb of the
Emir. Their actions seem, however, to have
been prompted partly by interested motives,
for their legend seems mysteriously to have
stated that great riches had been buried with
him, whose possession was only attainable by
human sacrifice. The easy consciences of
the fanatics do not appear to have felt any
scruples with regard to the means they were
to use, and in their zeal, stimulated by their
greed for gain and by superstition, they undertook
the long journey that, after perhaps
months of hardship and toil, led them to their
goal.</p>

<p>The day after their arrival they were seen
in twos and threes scouring the town, crossing
and recrossing all its streets under the
pretext of begging, but, as subsequently
discovered, with the real object of kidnapping
children. According to their confession,
forty was the number needed, whose fat
boiled down was to be moulded into tapers,
which, burning day and night on the tomb
of the Emir, were to soften the spirits into
complaisance and induce them to give up the
treasure they guarded in its original state,
and not in charcoal, as would be the case if
this all-important part of the operation were
omitted by the searchers. The news of the
appearance of the kidnappers, with some
inkling of their object, soon spread through
the town and began to terrorize the inhabitants
of the Christian quarters, where they
were principally seen loitering, when palpable
evidence of their operations was brought
before the English Consul by the timely rescue
of two Armenian children, who had been
half strangled, one being brought in insensible
and the other having on its throat the
deep and bleeding nail-marks of the two
ruffians from whose hands the children had
been rescued by some passers-by, who interrupted
the murderous work as it was being
executed in the sombre archway of a ruined
old Roman bridge crossing the ravine that intersects
the town. The Consul at once proceeded
to the Governor and requested that
the case should at once be looked into. But
the sacred character of Fakir protecting some
of these men made public investigation difficult,
and the authorities hushed up the matter,
and only signified to the band that they
must renounce their project and leave the
country. They did so, expressing their deep
regret at the want of faith of the authorities,
and bitterly reproaching them with their refusal
to co-operate tacitly with their desire.</p>

</div>

<p>The religion of the Turks is properly the
orthodox or <i>Sunni</i> form of Islam, the doctrines
of which are too well known to require
description here. But the subject is complicated
by the fact that there is a considerable
opposition between the popular and the
“respectable” religion. The Established
Church, so to speak, of Turkey is governed
by the Ulema, or learned men trained in the
mosques, often supported by pious endowments.
The popular faith, on the other
hand, is led by the various sects of dervishes,
between whom and the Ulema there
exists an unconquerable rivalry. Some account
of these two parties is essential to any
description of the people of Turkey.</p>

<p>The Ulema are the hereditary expounders
of the Koran, to the traditional interpretation
of which they rigidly adhere. They have
nothing to say to the many innovations that
time has shown to be needful in the religion
of Mohammed, and they brand as heretics all
who differ a hair’s-breadth from the old established
line. The result of this uncompromising
orthodoxy has been that the Ulema,
together with their subordinates the Softas
(a sort of Moslem undergraduates), have
managed to preserve an <i>esprit de corps</i> and a
firm collected line of action that is without
a parallel in Turkish parties.</p>

<p>Midhat Pasha and his party perceived this,
and made use of the Ulema as tools to effect
their purpose; but as soon as the <i>coup d’état</i>
was completed, Midhat Pasha’s first care
was to free himself as much as possible from
further obligations towards them, and to
break up their power by exile, imprisonment,
and general persecution. He understood that
if left to acquire further ascendency in public
affairs, great mischief would ensue. The
Ulema were clamoring loudly for reforms;
but the reforms they demanded were those
of the ancient Osmanlis and the execution of
the Sheriat or Koran laws, which, equitable
as they are among Mohammedans, would
not improve the condition of the rayah.
Herein lies the chief reason why reforms in
Turkey remain for the most part a dead letter.
The Koran has no conception of the
possibility of Christian subjects enjoying the
same rights as their Moslem neighbors. No
judge, therefore, likes to go against this
spirit; and no good Mohammedan can ever
bring himself to a level with a caste marked
by his Prophet with the brand of inferiority.
Midhat Pasha, thoroughly cognizant of this
fact, could not enter into a pact with the
Ulema, the strictest observers of the Koran
law, and at the same time satisfy the urgent
demands of Europe in favor of the Christian
subjects of the Porte. He did the best he
knew in the midst of these difficulties, and
produced his constitution. This was construed
in one light to the Mohammedans,
and in another to the Christians; whilst it
was intended to pacify Europe by insuring,
nominally at least, the reforms demanded by
her for the rayahs. Nobody, however, believed
in the Constitution. The Mohammedans
never meant to carry it into execution;
and Europe, in its divided opinions on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
subject, had the satisfaction of seeing it submerged
in the vortex of succeeding events.</p>

<p>The order of Ulema is divided into three
classes: the <i>Imams</i>, or ministers of religion;
the <i>Muftis</i>, doctors of the law; and the
<i>Kadis</i> or <i>Mollahs</i>, judges. Each of these
classes is subdivided into a number of others,
according to the rank and functions of those
that compose it.</p>

<p>The <i>imams</i>, after passing an examination,
are appointed by the Sheikh ul Islam to the
office of priests in the mosques. The fixed
pay they receive is small, about 6<i>l.</i> or 7<i>l.</i> per
annum. Some mosques have several imams.
Their functions are to pronounce the prayer
aloud and guide the ceremonies. The chief
imam has precedence over the other imams,
the muezzins (callers to prayer), the khatibs,
hodjas, and other servants of the mosque.</p>

<p>In small mosques, however, all these functions
are performed by the imam and the
muezzin. Imams are allowed to marry, and
their title is hereditary. Should the son be
unlettered, he appoints a deputy who performs
his duties. Imams, generally speaking,
are coarse and ignorant, and belong to
the lower-middle class of Turkish society.
Their influence in the parish is not great,
and the services they fulfil among their communities
consist in assisting in the parish
schools, giving licenses, and performing the
ceremonies of circumcision, marriage, and
of washing and burying the dead. They
live rent free, often deriving annuities from
church property. The communities pay no
fixed fees, but remuneration is given every
time the services of the imam are required
by a family. No Mohammedan house can
be entered by the police unless the imam of
the parish takes the lead and is the first to
knock at the door and cross the threshold.
Should the search be for a criminal in cases
of adultery, and the charge be brought by
the imam himself certifying the entrance of
the individual into the house, and the search
prove fruitless, the imam is liable to three
months’ imprisonment. A case of the kind
happened a few years ago to a highly respectable
imam in Stamboul, who, having for
some time noticed the disorderly conduct of
a hanoum of his parish, gave evidence, supported
by his two mukhtars, or parish officers,
of having seen some strangers enter the
house. The search leading to no discovery,
the hanoum demanded reparation for her
wounded honor, and the three functionaries
were cast into prison. The imam, on being
released, cut his throat, unable to survive the
indignation he felt at seeing the evidence of
three respectable persons slighted and set
aside before the protestations of false virtue,
backed by bribes.</p>

<p>This is one of the strange licenses of Turkish
law. Crime is not punished unless its
actual commission is certified by eye-witnesses;
this is the reason that evidence of
crime committed during the night is not admitted
as valid by the laws of the country.
The imams, under the pressure of this law,
think twice before they give evidence; nor
do they much like the unpleasant duty of
accompanying police inspections, from which
they generally excuse themselves.</p>

<p>The <i>muftis</i>, or doctors of the law, rank
next: seated in the courts of justice, they
receive the pleas, examine into the cases,
and explain them to the mollah, according
to their merits or the turn they may wish to
give to them. There is very general complaint
against the corruption of these men, in
whose hands lies the power of misconstruing
the law.</p>

<p>The <i>mollahs</i> or <i>kadis</i> form the next grade in
the Ulema hierarchy. They are appointed
by the Sheikh ul Islam, and are assisted in
their functions by the muftis and other officials.</p>

<p>The avarice and venality of this body of
men are among the worst features of Turkish
legislature. Few judges are free from
the reproach of partiality and corruption.
Their verdicts, delivered nominally in accordance
with Koranic law, are often gross misinterpretations
of the law, and the <i>fetvahs</i> or
sentences in which they are expressed are
given in a sense that complicates matters to
such a degree as to render a revisal of the
case useless, and redress hopeless, unless the
pleader is well backed by powerful protectors,
or can afford to spend vast sums in
bribes—when, perhaps, he may sometimes,
after much trouble and delay, obtain justice.</p>

<p>The Kadi Asker of Roumelia and the Kadi
Asker of Anatolia come next in rank as supreme
judges; the former of Turkey in Europe,
and the latter of Turkey in Asia; they
sit in the same court of justice as the Sheikh
ul Islam.</p>

<p>This Sheikh ul Islam, or Grand Mufti of
the capital, is the spiritual chief of Islam and
the head of the legislature. He is appointed
by the Sultan, who installs him in his functions
with a long pelisse of sable. The Sultan
can deprive him of his office, but not of
life so long as he holds his title, nor can he
confiscate his property when in disgrace.</p>

<p>The chief function of the Grand Mufti is
to interpret the Koran in all important cases.
His decisions are laconic, often consisting of
“Yes” or “No.” His opinions, delivered in
accordance with the Koran, are not backed
by motive.</p>

<p>In instances of uncertainty he has a way
of getting out of the difficulty by adding
“God is the best judge.” His decrees are
called <i>fetvahs</i>, and he signs himself, in the
common formula, “the poor servant of
God.” He is assisted in his functions by a
secretary called the <i>fetvah eminé</i>, who in
cases of minor importance directs the pleas
and presents them all ready for the affixing
of the mufti’s seal.</p>

<p>The influence of the Sheikh ul Islam is
great, and powerful for good or harm to the
nation, according to his character, and the
amount of justice and honesty he may display
in his capacity of Head of Islam and supreme
judge. This influence, however, being
strictly Mohammedan, and based on
rigid religious dogmas, cannot be expected to
carry with it that spirit of tolerance and liberality
which a well regulated government must
possess in all branches of the administrative
and executive power. Instances, however, in
which Sheikhs ul Islam have shown strict
honesty, justice, and even a certain amount
of enlightened tolerance, have not been unfrequent
in the annals of Turkey, in the settlement
of disputes between Mussulmans and
non-Mussulmans.</p>

<p>I have heard several curious stories about
the Grand Muftis of this century. Whilst
Lord Stratford was ambassador at Constantinople,
one of the secretaries had an audience
with the Sheikh ul Islam, who at the moment
of his visitor’s entrance was engaged in
the performance of his <i>namaz</i>. The secretary
sat down while the devotee finished his
prayers, which were ended by an invocation
to Allah to forgive a suppliant true believer
the sin of holding direct intercourse with a
Giaour. His conscience thus relieved, the
old mufti rose from his knees and smilingly
welcomed his guest. But this guest, who
was a great original, in his turn begged
permission to perform his devotions. He
gravely went through an Arabic formula,
and ended by begging Allah to forgive a
good Christian the crime of visiting a “faithless
dog of an infidel.” The astonished old
mufti was nettled, but with true Oriental imperturbability
he bore the insult.</p>

<p>A late Grand Mufti was greatly respected,
and appealed to from all directions for the
settlement of new and old lawsuits, which
he is said to have wound up with strict impartiality
and justice; but at the same time
he always urged upon the disputants the advantages
of coming to an amicable arrangement.</p>

<p>One of his friends, observing that this advice
systematically accompanied the winding-up
of the case, asked the dignitary why,
being sure of having delivered a just sentence,
he recommended this friendly arrangement?
“Because,” said the mufti, “the
world nowadays is so corrupt, and the use
of false witnesses so common, that I believe
in the honesty of none; and my conscience
is free when I have obtained something in
favor of the loser as well as the winner.”</p>

<p>From the time of the annexation of Egypt
and Syria by Selim the Inflexible, the title of
Khalif, or Vicar of God, was assumed by
the Turkish Sultan; but although this title
gives him the power of a complete autocrat,
no Sultan can be invested with the Imperial
dignity unless the Mollah of Konia, a descendant
of the Osmanjiks, and by right of his
descent considered holy, comes to Constantinople,
and girds the future sovereign with
the sword of Othman; on the other hand, a
Sultan cannot be deposed unless a Fetvah of
the Sheikh ul Islam decrees his deposition,
or, if by consent of the nation, his death.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the Ulema—the clergy, so
to speak, of the Established Church of Islam
in Turkey. They are the ultra-conservative
party in the nation in things political as well
as things religious. “Let things be,” is the
motto of the Sheikh ul Islam and his most
insignificant Kadi. It is not surprising that
this should be so. Trained in the meagre
curriculum of the Medressé, among the dry
bones of traditional Moslem theology, it
would be astonishing if these men were aught
but narrow, ignorant, bigoted; and chained
in the unvarying circle of the Ulema world
they have no chance of forgetting the teaching
of their youth. But this does not explain
the fact that nine out of ten Moslem
judges are daily guilty of injustice and the
taking of bribes.</p>

<p>The Ulema entertain a cordial hatred for
the dervishes, whose orthodoxy they deny,
and whose influence over the State and the
people alike they dread. The dervish’s title
to reverence does not, like his rival’s, rest
upon his learning and his ability to misinterpret
the Koran; it rests on his supposed
inspiration. On this ground, as well as on
account of his reputed power of working
miracles, and the general eccentricity of his
life, he is regarded by the people with extreme
veneration. His sympathies, moreover,
are with the masses; ofttimes he
spends his life in succoring them; whilst
his scorn for the wealthy and reputable
knows no bounds. Hence the people believe
in the dervishes in spite of the ridicule and
persecution of the Ulema; and even the
higher classes become infected with this
partly superstitious veneration, and seek to
gain the dervish’s blessing and to avoid his
curse; and often a high dignitary has turned
pale at the stern denunciation of the wild-looking
visionary who does not fear to say
his say before the great ones of the land.
Sultan Mahmoud was once crossing the
bridge of Galata when he was stopped by a
dervish called “the hairy sheikh.” “Giaour
Padishah,” he cried, in a voice shaken
with fury, seizing the Sultan’s bridle, “art
thou not yet content with abomination?
Thou wilt answer to God for all thy godlessness!
Thou art destroying the institutions
of thy brethren; thou revilest Islam and
drawest the vengeance of the Prophet upon
thyself and us.” The Sultan called to his
guards to clear “the fool” out of the way.
“I a fool!” screamed the dervish. “It is
thou and thy worthless counsellors who have
lost your senses! To the rescue, Moslems!
The Spirit of God, who hath anointed me,
and whom I serve, urges me to proclaim the
truth, with the promise of the reward of the
saints.” The next day the visionary was
put to death; but it was declared that the
following night a soft light was shed over his
tomb, which is still venerated as that of a
saint.</p>

<p>But it needed a bold man like the reformer-Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
to put a noisy fanatic to death; and
even in his case the wisdom, as well as the
humanity, of the act may be questioned.
Most grandees would think twice before they
offended a dervish. For popular credulity
accords to these strange men extraordinary
powers—the gift of foreknowledge, the
power of working miracles, and of enduring
privations and sufferings beyond the limits
of ordinary human endurance; and, not
least, these enthusiasts are believed to have
the power of giving people good or evil
wishes, which never fail to come to pass, and
which no human action can resist.</p>

<p>In spite of this apparently fanatical and
charlatan character, there is much that is
liberal and undogmatical about the dervishes.
I have certainly met with many broad-minded,
tolerant men among the sheikhs of
their orders, and have been struck by the
charm of their conversation no less than their
enlightened views and their genuine good-will
towards mankind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, though asceticism is
part of the dervish’s creed, and though there
be among them really honest and great men,
it must be admitted that a good many dervishes
entertain not the faintest scruples
about intoxication and a good many other
pleasures which do not seem very strictly in
accordance with their vows. Among the
wandering dervishes many savage and thoroughly
bad characters are to be met with.
They roam from country to country; climate,
privation, hardships of all kinds, deter
them not; they come from all lands and they
go to all lands, but those of Persia and Bokhara
surpass the rest in cunning, fanaticism,
and brutality. There is no vice into which
some of them do not plunge; and all the
time they display a revolting excess of religious
zeal, couched in the foulest and most
abusive vocabulary their language affords.</p>

<p>One of these wretches once stopped my carriage
under the windows of the Governor’s
house at Monastir, and before the kavass had
time to interfere he had jumped in and was
vociferating “Giaour” and a host of other
invectives in my face. It was lucky the
guard was near and prompt in arresting him.
Next day he was packed out of the town for
the fourth time.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their vices, nothing can
exceed the veneration in which the dervishes
are held by the public, over whom they exercise
an irresistible influence. This influence
is especially made use of in time of war,
when a motley company of sheikhs and fanatical
dervishes join the army, and encourage
the officers and men by rehearsing the benefits
promised by the Prophet to all who fight
or die for the true faith. The voices of these
excited devotees may be heard crying, “O
ye victorious!” “O ye martyrs!” or “Yallah!”
Some of these men are fearful fanatics,
who endeavor by every means in their
power to stimulate the religious zeal of the
troops and of the nation. Every word they
utter is poison to public peace. Among the
numerous gangs of infatuated zealots that
spread themselves over the country just before
the outbreak of the troubles in Bulgaria,
there was one wandering dervish who specially
distinguished himself by the pernicious
influence his prophecies and adjurations obtained
over the minds of the Mohammedan
population, exciting them against their Christian
neighbors, who were completely “terrorized”
by his denunciations.</p>

<p>The venerable Bishop of the town of L⸺
related to me the visit he had received from
this dangerous individual, and assured me
that this fanatic was in some measure the
cause of the lamentable events that followed.</p>

<p>He first appeared in the town of X⸺,
where, after preaching his death mission
among the Mohammedans a few days before
the Greek Easter, he walked up to the quarter
of the town occupied by some of the
principal Christian families, and knocking at
each door entered and announced to the inmates
that Allah had revealed to him His
pleasure and His decrees for the destruction
of the infidels within the third day of Easter.
On reaching the dwelling of the Bishop he
requested a personal interview, and made the
same declaration to him.</p>

<p>The Bishop, with some of the leading inhabitants,
alarmed at this threatening speech,
proceeded at once to the Governor-General,
and related the incident to him. The dervish
was sent for, and, in the presence of the
Bishop and his companions, asked if he had
said what was reported of him, and what he
meant by such an assertion. The dervish
merely shrugged his shoulders, and said that
he was in his <i>hal</i>, or ecstatic state, and could
not therefore be answerable for what he
talked about. The Pasha sent him under
escort to the town of A⸺, with a letter to
the governor of that place requesting his exile
to Broussa; but the wily ascetic soon
managed to escape the surveillance of the
police of A⸺, and continued his mission
in other parts of Bulgaria.</p>

<p>It is impossible here to enter into details as
to the constitution of the various dervish orders
(of which there are many), or the tenets
held by them, or the ceremonies of initiation
and of worship. Still, a few words are necessary
about the two or three leading orders
of dervishes in Turkey. The most graceful
are the Mevlevi, or revolving dervishes, with
their sugar-loaf hats, long skirts, and loose
<i>jubbés</i>. Once or twice a week public service
is performed at the Mevlevi Khané, to
which spectators are admitted. The devotions
begin by the recital of the usual <i>namaz</i>,
after which the sheikh proceeds to his <i>pistiki</i>,
or sheepskin mat, and raising his hands offers
with great earnestness the prayer to the
<i>Pir</i>, or spirit of the founder of the order,
asking his intercession with God on behalf
of the order. He then steps off his <i>pistiki</i>
and bows his head with deep humility towards
it, as if it were now occupied by his
<i>Pir</i>; then, in slow and measured step, he
walks three times round the Semar Khané,
bowing to the right and left with crossed
toes as he passes his seat, his subordinates
following and doing the same. This part of
the ceremony (called the Sultan Veled Devri)
over, the sheikh stands on the <i>pistiki</i> with
bowed head, while the brethren in the
<i>mutrib</i>, or orchestra, chant a hymn in honor
of the Prophet, followed by a sweet and harmonious
performance on the flute.</p>

<p>The Semar Zan, director of the performance,
proceeds to the sheikh, who stands on
the edge of his <i>pistiki</i>, and, after making a
deep obeisance, walks to the centre of the
hall, and gives a signal to the other brethren,
who let fall their <i>tennouris</i>, take off their
<i>jubbés</i>, and proceed in single file with folded
arms to the sheikh, kiss his hand, receive in
return a kiss on their hats, and there begin
whirling round, using the left foot as a pivot
while they push themselves round with the
right. Gradually the arms are raised upwards
and then extended outwards, the palm
of the right hand being turned up and the
left bent towards the floor. With closed
eyes and heads reclining towards the right
shoulder they continue turning, muttering
the inaudible <i>zikr</i>, saying, “Allah, Allah!”
to the sound of the orchestra and the chant
that accompanies it, ending with the exclamation,
“O friend!” when the dancers suddenly
cease to turn. The sheikh, still standing,
again receives the obeisance of the brethren
as they pass his <i>pistiki</i>, and the dance is
renewed. When it is over, they resume
their seats on the floor, and are covered with
their <i>jubbés</i>. The service ends with a prayer
for the Sultan.</p>

<p>The whole of the ceremony is extremely
harmonious and interesting: the bright and
variegated colors of the dresses, the expert
and graceful way in which the dervishes
spin round, bearing on their faces at the
same time a look of deep humility and devotion,
together with the dignified attitude and
movements of the sheikh, combine to form a
most impressive sight.</p>

<p>Equally curious are the Rifa’i, or howling
dervishes. They wear a mantle edged with
green, a belt in which are lodged one or three
big stones, to compress the hunger to which
a dervish is liable, and a white felt hat
marked with eight grooves (<i>terks</i>), each denoting
the renunciation of a cardinal sin. In
their devotions they become strangely excited,
their limbs become frightfully contorted,
their faces deadly pale; then they dance in
the most grotesque manner, howling meanwhile;
cut themselves with knives, swallow
fire and swords, burn their bodies, pierce
their ears, and finally swoon. A sacred
word whispered by two elders of the order
brings the unconscious men round, and their
wounds are healed by the touch of the
sheikh’s hand, moistened from his mouth. It
is strange and horrible to witness the ceremonies
of this order; but in these barbarous performances
the devout recognize the working
of the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>But the order which is admitted to be the
most numerous and important in Turkey is
that of the <i>Bektashis</i>. Like all dervish orders,
they consider themselves the first and
greatest religious sect in the universe; and
for this they have the following excellent
reason. One day their founder, Hadji Bektash,
and some of his followers were sitting
on a wall, when they saw a rival dervish approaching
them, mounted upon a roaring
lion, which he chastised by means of a serpent
which he held in his hand as a whip.
The disciples marvelling at this, Hadji Bektash
said: “My brothers, there is no merit
in riding a lion; but there is merit in making
the wall on which we are sitting advance towards
the lion, and stop the way of the lion
and its rider.” Whereupon the wall marched
slowly upon the enemy, carrying Hadji
Bektash and his followers against the lion-rider,
who saw nothing for it but to acknowledge
the supremacy of the rival sheikh.</p>

<p>The Bektashis are followers of the Khalif
Ali, and attribute to him and his descendants
all the extravagant qualities which the Alides
have from time to time invented. These
dervishes have also many superstitious beliefs
connected with their girdle, cap, and
cloak. One ceremony with the stone worn
in the girdle is rather striking. The sheikh
puts it in and out seven times, saying, “I tie
up greediness and unbind generosity. I tie
up anger and unbind meekness. I tie up ignorance
and unbind the fear of God. I tie
up passion and unbind the love of God. I
tie up the devilish and unbind the divine.”</p>

<p>The special veneration of the Khalif Ali by
this order renders it particularly hateful to
the orthodox Mussulmans; and yet, strange
to say, it acquired great popularity in the
Ottoman Empire, especially among the Janissaries,
who when first formed into a corps
were blessed by Hadji Bektash in person.
The new troops are said to have been led by
Sultan Orkhan into the presence of the sheikh
near Amassia, when the Sultan implored
his benediction, and the gift of a standard
and a flag for his new force. The sheikh,
stretching out one of his arms over the head
of a soldier, with the end of the sleeve hanging
down behind, blessed the corps, calling
it <i>yenicheri</i>, the “new troop,” prophesying
at the same time that “its figure shall be
fair and shining, its arm redoubtable, its
sword cutting, and its arrows steeled. It
shall be victorious in all battles, and only return
triumphant.” A pendant representing
the sleeve of the sheikh was added to the felt
cap of the Janissaries in commemoration of
the benediction of Hadji Bektash. Most of
the Janissaries were incorporated into the order
of Bektashis, and formed that formidable
body of men, who, adding the profession of
the monk to the chivalrous spirit of the warrior,
may be considered the Knights Templars
of Islam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>During the reign of Sultan Mahmoud II.
the destruction of the Janissaries was followed
by the persecution of the Bektashis,
for whom the orthodox Mohammedans of the
present day entertain a sovereign contempt.</p>

<p>The votaries of the Bektashi order in European
Turkey are most numerous among the
Albanians, where they are said to number
over 80,000. A few years ago they were
subjected to persecutions, which seem to have
been caused by the little regard they displayed
for the forms of orthodox Islam, from
which they widely deviate. The point that
gives special offence to the Turk is the little
attention paid by the wives of these sectarians
to the Mussulman laws of <i>namekhram</i> (concealment),
with which they all dispense when
the husband gives them permission to appear
before his friends. Polygamy is only practised
among Albanian Bektashis when the
first wife has some defect or infirmity.</p>

<p>There is much that is virtuous and liberal
in the tenets of this order, but very little of
it is put into practice. This neglect is proved
by the disordered and unscrupulous lives
often led by Bektashis, and is accounted for
by the existence of two distinct paths they
feel equally authorized to follow: one leading
to the performance of all the duties and
virtues prescribed, and the other in which
they lay these aside and follow the bent of
their own natural inclinations.</p>

<p>Some of the principal monasteries of the
Bektashis are to be found in Asia Minor in
the vilayet of Broussa. A Greek gentleman
of my acquaintance had strange adventures
in one of their settlements at M⸺, where
his roving disposition had led him to purchase
an estate. After living for some years
among this half-savage set, he became a
great favorite, was received into their order,
and finally elected as their chief, when he
was presented with the emblematic stones of
the order, which he wore on his person.
One day, however, he narrowly escaped paying
dearly for the honor.</p>

<p>A herd of pigs belonging to him escaped
from the farm, and took the road to the
<i>Tekké</i>, into which they rushed, while the
congregation were assembled for their devotions.
The excited animals, grunting and
squealing, mingled wildly with the devotees,
profaning the sacred edifice and its occupants
by their detested presence. The Bektashis
sprang to their feet, and with one accord
cried out to the owner of the unclean
animals to ask if, in consequence of his infidel
origin, he had played this trick upon
them, and declaring that if it were so he
should pay the forfeit with his life. The
Bektashi sheikh displayed remarkable presence
of mind at this critical moment. Rising
to his feet, he looked round, assumed an attitude
and expression of deep devotion, and
in an inspired voice exclaimed, “Oh, ye ignorant
and benighted brethren, see ye not
that these swine, enlightened from on high,
are impelled to confess the true faith and
to join us in our worship? Let them pass
through the ordeal, and tax not a creature of
Allah with the effecting of an event for which
He alone is responsible.” Strange to say,
this explanation satisfied the devotees. It illustrates
curiously the peculiar character of
the dervishes, their faith in their sheikhs,
and their belief in extraordinary inspiration.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of Islam are observed in
Turkey in much the same way as in other
Moslem countries. On Friday all good, and
most indifferent, Mohammedans go to the
mosque for the public prayer; but of course
there is no touch of Sabbatarianism among
the Turks any more than among any other
followers of Mohammed. In most mosques
women are admitted to a retired part of the
edifice; but it is only elderly ladies who go.
In some mosques at Stamboul, where the
women’s department is partitioned off, the attendance
is larger, especially during Ramazan.
Last year I went dressed as a Turkish
lady to the evening prayer during the fast.
It was a strange sight to me, and the excitement
was increased by the knowledge of the
unpleasant consequences that would follow
the penetration of my disguise. The Turkish
women seemed out of place there: their levity
contrasted markedly with the grave bearing
of the men on the other side of the partition.
The view I thus obtained of the
beautiful mosque of Sultan Ahmet was singularly
impressive. The Ulema, in their
green and white turbans and graceful robes,
absorbed in the performance of their religious
duties; officers in bright uniforms, and civilians
in red fez and black coat, side by side
with wild-looking dervishes and the common
people in the varied and picturesque costumes
of the different nations, all knelt in rows
upon the soft carpets, or went through the
various postures of that religion before which
all men are equal. Not a whisper disturbed
the clear melodious voice of the old Hodja as
he pronounced the Terravi prayers, which
the congregation took up in chorus, now
prostrating their faces on the ground, now
slowly rising: you could fancy it a green
corn-field, studded with poppies, billowing
under the breeze. Above were the numberless
lamps that shone in the stately dome.</p>

<p>You can give no higher praise to a Turk
than saying that he performs his five prayers
a-day. In right of this qualification young
men of no position and as little merit are
often chosen as sons-in-law by pious people.
A Turk of the old school is proud of his religion,
and is never ashamed of letting you
see it. So long as he can turn his face towards
Mekka, he will say his prayers anywhere.
The Turks like to say their <i>namaz</i> in
public, that they may have praise of men;
and it is to be feared that a good deal of hypocrisy
goes on in this matter. This, however,
is on the decrease, because fewer Turks
in all classes say their prayers or observe the
outward forms of religion than formerly.
This is no doubt partly due to the influence
of “Young Turkey,” though other causes
are also at work.</p>

<p>But the orthodox Turk must do more than
observe the prayers. The fast of Ramazan is
a very important part of his religious routine.
Every one knows this terrible month
of day-fasting and night-feasting. It tells
most severely on the poor, who keep it
strictly, and are compelled to work during
the day exactly as when not fasting. Women
also of all classes observe the fast religiously.
But there are very few among the
higher officials, or the gentlemen who have
enrolled themselves under the banner of <i>La
Jeune Turquie</i>, who take any notice of it,
except in public, where they are obliged to
show outward respect to the prejudices of
the people.</p>

<p>This fast-month is a sort of revival-time to
the Moslems. They are supposed to devote
more time to the careful study of the Koran
and to the minute practice of its ordinances.
Charity, peacefulness, hospitality, almsgiving,
are among the virtues which they specially
cultivate at this time; and though the
theory is not put in practice to the letter, and
hospitality not carried out as originally intended—the
rich man standing at his door at
sunset, bringing in and setting at his table all
the poor that happened to pass by, and sending
them away with presents of money—it is
still very largely practised.</p>

<p>I have often partaken of an <i>Iftar</i>, or Ramazan
dinner. It is very curious to observe
the physiognomy of the <i>Terriakis</i>, or great
smokers and coffee-drinkers, who, as the moment
of indulgence approaches, become restless
and cross, now sighing for the firing of
the gun that proclaims the fast at an end,
now indulging in bad language to the people
who gather round and tease them. As the
sun approaches the horizon, a tray is brought
in laden with all sorts of sweets, salads, salt
fish, Ramazan cakes, fruit and olives, contained
in the tiniest coffee-saucers, together
with goblets of delicious iced sherbet.
When the gun is fired every one utters a
<i>Bismillah</i> and takes an olive, that fruit being
considered five times more blessed than water
to break the fast with. After the contents
of the tray have been sparingly partaken of,
dinner is announced, and all gather round
the <i>sofra</i>; few, however, eat with appetite,
or relish the dinner half so much as they do
the cup of coffee and cigarettes that follow.</p>

<p>During Ramazan night is turned into day,
and the streets then remind one of carnival
time in Catholic countries. The wealthy sit
up all night, receiving and returning calls,
giving evening parties, spending the time in
a round of feasts and entertainments. At
Stamboul, when the prayer of the <i>Terravi</i>—which
is recited two hours after sunset—is
over in the mosque, all the people betake
themselves to the esplanade of the Sulimanieh,
and hundreds of elegant carriages containing
Turkish beauties may be seen cutting
their way through the dense crowd of promenaders.
The bazars are illuminated, and all
the fruit and refreshment shops are open.
Eating, drinking sherbet, and smoking, is
the order of the evening, besides a great
amount of flirtation. I cannot say that there
is much taste or refinement in this unusual
but tacitly recognized passing intercourse.
The ladies all appear in high spirits, and tolerate,
and even seem amused by, the acts of
gross impertinence to which they are subjected
by male passers-by. Some of the fast
men and <i>mauvais sujets</i> indulge in acts and
language that would certainly obtain the interference
of the police in an orderly society.</p>

<p>I accompanied some friends, the family of
one of the ministers, to this evening entertainment.
We had six servants round the
carriage, but they were no protection against
the heaps of rubbish in the shape of lighted
cigarette ends, parched peas, capsicums, and
fruit of all kinds thrown into it, not to speak
of the licentious little speeches addressed to
us by passing beaux. My friends advised me
to be on my guard, as action is often added
to word, and the arms and hands of the occupants
of the vehicles made to smart from
the liberties taken with them. Thus forewarned,
I took care to shut the window on
my side of the carriage; a little scream from
my companions every now and then, when
we found ourselves in the densest part of the
crowd, followed by a shower of abuse from
the negress sitting opposite us, showed that
my precaution had not been needless. The
little respect paid to women in this indiscriminate
<i>mêlée</i>, where the dignity of the Sultana
was no more regarded than the modesty
of the lowly pedestrian, struck me forcibly.
It made the greater impression upon me as it
contrasted strongly with the respect paid to
her under other circumstances. In steam-boats,
for example, an unattended Turkish
woman is seldom known to be insulted, even
when her conduct gives provocation.</p>

<p>Three hours before dawn, drums are beaten
and verses sung through the streets to warn
the people to prepare for the <i>sahor</i>, or supper,
after which an hour’s leisure is accorded
for smoking and coffee-drinking, when the
firing of a gun announces the moment for rinsing
the mouth and sealing it against food till
sunset. All business is put off by the wealthy
during the day, which is filled up by sleep;
while the poor go through the day’s work
unrefreshed.</p>

<p>Pilgrimages, though less practised now
than formerly in Turkey, are still considered
the holiest actions of a Mohammedan’s life.
The most perfect is the one embracing the
visit to the four sacred spots of Islam—Damascus,
Jerusalem, Mekka, and Medina;
but the long journey that this would entail,
the dangers and difficulties that surround it,
are checks upon all but the most zealous of
pilgrims, and only a few hardy and enterprising
individuals perform the duty in full.
The pilgrims, collected from all parts of the
country, leave Constantinople in a body fifteen
days before the fast of Ramazan. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Government facilitates this departure by giving
free passages and other grants. Those
pilgrims that go <i>viâ</i> Damascus are the
bearers of the Imperial presents to the holy
shrines. Every Hadji on returning from
Mekka bears a token of his pilgrimage in a
tattoo mark on his arm and between his
thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>I cannot close a chapter on Islam in Turkey
without referring to a belief which,
though but vaguely introduced into the original
faith of Mohammed, has come to mean
everything to the Turk. I mean <i>Kismet</i>. It
is not, of course, the belief in an inevitable
destiny that is remarkable: all nations have
their share in that, and modern Christianity
has sometimes carefully formulated the doctrine
of the fatalist. It is rather the intensity
of the Turk’s belief, and his dogged insistance
on its logical results, that make it so
extraordinary. Many people besides Turks
believe in destiny, but their belief does not
prevent them from consulting their doctor or
avoiding infection. With the Turk all such
precautions are vain: if it is kismet that
a thing shall happen, happen it will, and
what then is the good of trying to avert it?
Everything in Turkey is controlled by kismet.
If a man suffers some trifling loss, it
is kismet; if he die, it is also kismet. He
marries by kismet, and shortly divorces his
wife by the same influence. He succeeds in
life, or he fails: it is kismet. Sultans succeed
one another—again kismet. Armies go
forth to conquer or to be conquered—Fate
rules the event. It is useless to fight against
the decrees of kismet. That Fate helps him
who helps himself is a doctrine incomprehensible
to the Turk. He lies passive in the
hand of destiny: it would be impious to
rebel.</p>

<p>The effects of this doctrine lie on the surface.
Not only are lives constantly sacrificed,
and wealth and happiness lost by this
fatal principle of passivity, but the whole
character of the nation is enfeebled. The
Turk has no rightful ambition: if it is kismet
he should succeed, well and good; but
if not, no efforts of his own can avail him.
Hence he smokes his chibouk and makes no
efforts at all. Something might be done with
him if he would only show some energy of
character; but this doctrine has sapped that
energy at the root, and there is no vitality
left.</p>

<p>This is the main disastrous result of fatalism:
it has destroyed the vigor of a once
powerful nation. But every day brings forth
instances of lesser evils flowing from the same
source. It is hardly necessary to point out
in how many ways a fatalist injures himself
and all belonging to him. One or two common
cases will be enough. I have already
referred to the neglect of all sanitary precautions
as one of the results of the belief in kismet.
This neglect is shown in a thousand
ways; but one or two instances that I remember
may point the moral. Turkey is
especially liable to epidemics, and of course
the havoc they create is terrible among a passive
population. In all district towns the
Turks manifest the greatest possible dislike
and opposition to every species of quarantine:
they regard quarantine regulations as
profane interference with the decrees of God,
and systematically disregard them. The doctor
of the first quarantine establishment at
Broussa was assaulted in the street by several
hundred Turkish women, who beat him
nearly to death, from which he was only
saved by the police. Small-pox is among the
most fatal of the scourges that invade the
people, and Turkish children are frequently
victims to it; yet it is with the utmost difficulty
that a Turk can be induced to vaccinate
his child, though, happily, the precaution
is now more practised than it used to be.</p>

<p>Separation in sickness is another of the
measures Turks can never be made to take.
A short time ago a girl of fourteen, the
daughter of our <i>kavass</i>, was seized with an
attack of quinsy. As soon as I heard of it I
begged our doctor to accompany me to the
Mohammedan quarter and visit the invalid.
We found her lying on a clean <i>shelté</i>, or mattress,
on the floor, which was equally occupied
by her young brothers and sisters, who
were playing round and trying to amuse her.
The doctor’s first care was to send away the
children, and recommend that they should on
no account be allowed to come near her, as her
throat was in a most terrible condition. Both
parents declared that it would be impossible
to keep them away; besides, if it was their
kismet to be also visited by the disease, nothing
could avert it. The room occupied by
the sick girl was clean and tidy; the doors
and windows, facing the sea, fronted by a
veranda, were open, and the house being
situated in the highest part of the town, under
the ruins of the old walls, the sharp April
air was allowed free access to the chamber
most injuriously to the invalid. On the attention
of the parents being drawn to the
fact, they simply answered that the feverish
state of the child needed the cool air to such
an extent that twice during the preceding
night she had left her room and gone down to
the yard to repose upon the cold stone slabs
in order to cool herself!</p>

<p>In spite of every effort to save her, she
died on the third night from exhaustion
caused by her refusal to take the medicines
and nourishment provided for her, and to be
kept in her chamber, which she had abandoned,
taking up her quarters on the balcony,
where we saw her on the last day. On visiting
the family after the sad event, we found
the unhappy parents distracted with sorrow,
but still accepting it with fatalistic resignation,
saying that “her <i>edjel</i> had come to call
her away from among the living.”</p>

<p>Our attention was next attracted by three
of the children. The youngest, a baby, appeared
choking from the effects of the same
complaint, and died the same night. The
other two, a boy and girl, also attacked, were
playing about, although in high fever and
with dreadfully swollen throats. The doctor
begged that they should be sent to bed,
to which they both refused to submit, while
the parents phlegmatically said that it would
be a useless measure, as they could not be
kept there, and that if it should be their kismet
to recover they would do so. I am glad
to say they did recover, though I am afraid
their recovery did not convert the doctor and
me to a belief in kismet.</p>

<p>Owing to this fatal and general way of
treating sickness, the prescriptions of physicians,
neither believed in nor carried out,
are useless; besides, they are always interfered
with and disputed by quacks and old
women, and the muskas, prayers, and blowings
of saintly Hodjas.</p>

<p>When the patient survives this extraordinary
combination of nursing, it is simply
stated that his <i>edjel</i> or death-summons has
not yet arrived.</p>

<p>If a man die away from his home and
country, his kismet is supposed to have summoned
him to die on the spot that received
his body.</p>

<p>Kismet thus being the main fountain
whence the Mohammedan draws with equanimity
both the good and the evil it may
please Providence to pour forth upon him,
he receives both with the stoicism of the
born-and-bred fatalist, who looks upon every
effort of his own to change the decrees of
destiny as vain and futile. Hence he becomes
<i>Moslem</i>, or “resigned,” in the most
literal sense. His character gains that quality
of inertness which we associate with the
Oriental, and his nation becomes, what a nation
cannot become and live—stagnant.</p>

</div>

<p>It has long been the custom to fling a good
deal of contumely on the Holy Orthodox or
Greek Church. Judging from the descriptions
of trustworthy writers, from conversations
I have often held with persons of
authority on the subject, and from personal
observation, I feel convinced that if part of
the abuse heaped upon the Greek Church is
well founded, the greater portion is due to
the rivalry and hatred of the Western Church,
and to the antipathy felt by the Reformed
Church towards her superstitions and formalities;
but a still stronger reason may be
found in the errors the church still harbors,
and in the ignorance in which her clergy remained
so long plunged. Taking this as a
general rule, and lamenting its consequences,
we should on the other hand bear in mind
the great antiquity of the church and its
early services to Christianity. Some of its
rites and ceremonies are certainly superstitious
and superfluous, but there is none of
the intolerance of the Romish Church, nor
are religious persecutions to be laid to its
charge. Its clergy, stigmatized as venal and
ignorant tools in the hands of the Turks,
have nevertheless had their virtues and redeeming
points counterbalancing their evil
repute. The rivalry of the upper clergy
originated principally in the corrupt system
of bribery pursued by them in their relations
with the Porte for the grant of <i>berats</i> or diplomas
installing the Patriarchs in their respective
seats, and the practice indulged in
by the Patriarchs of selling bishoprics at a
price in proportion to the wealth of the diocese.
Yet in the midst of this darkness there
were still found men to carry on the work of
culture and uphold the dignity of the church.
Nor have the Greek clergy always been the
cringing servants of the Porte, or the go-betweens
of the Turks and the rayahs; in
the list of the Patriarchs we find many who,
in the midst of difficulties inevitable in serving
a government foreign to their church and
hostile to the hopes and aspirations of their
people, hesitated not in moments of supreme
need to sacrifice position, fortune, and even
life, under most horrible circumstances, for
the sake of the church. With memories of
such martyrdoms ever present in the minds
of a dependent clergy, it is not surprising to
find this section of the Greek nation apparently
so subservient to their rulers. The
past, however, with all its blots, is rapidly
passing away; the rules now followed by
the Patriarchate in fixed salaries and written
regulations with regard to certain contributions
have put an end to many former
abuses. The theological schools, rapidly increasing
in number and importance in Turkey
as well as in Greece, have also a beneficial
effect on the training of the clergy, who
daily attaining a higher standard in morality,
mental development, and social position, have
of late years been enabled not only to maintain
a more determined and independent
attitude before the civil authorities, but
also largely to increase their influence in
promoting the education of their flocks. The
old class of clergy is dying out, and gradually
a new and different set of men is coming
forward.</p>

<p>The commonest charge that is brought
against the Greek Church is its accumulation
of superstitions. But the people are beginning
to drop the more absurd ceremonies
and treat the more preposterous superstitions
with indifference. It is true that the church
itself is not yet taking the lead in this matter,
as how should it? I have often talked
on this subject with ecclesiastics of the Eastern
faith, and they admit both the absurdity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of many of the rites practised and the beliefs
inculcated, and also the tendency of the
people to neglect these rites and to disbelieve
these superstitions; but they say that any
action on the part of the church would lead
to the serious injury both of itself and the
Greek nation; for a general synod would
have to be held to deliberate on the necessary
reforms; schisms would at once arise, and
the Greek Church, and hence the Greek nation,
would be disintegrated. However, I
believe there are too many sensible men
among the Greek clergy for this weak position
to be maintained long. The church
must reform if it is to remain the church of
the Greeks.</p>

<p>At present, however, the priests are afraid
to move. They dare not admit the falsity of
parts of their doctrine and the absurdity of
their practices, for fear of wider consequences.
For example, a miraculous fire
is supposed to spring from the supposed
tomb of Christ on Easter Sunday. The
Greek clergy do not actually assert it to be a
miracle—at least not to Westerns—but if
questioned about it they invariably give an
evasive answer; and the priest still continues
solemnly to light his taper from the tomb and
present it to the congregation saying, “Take,
then, the flame from the Eternal Light,
and praise Christ who is risen from the
dead.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> A similar ceremony is observed on
a small scale in every Greek church at Easter,
when the congregation light their tapers from
the altar and the same formula is used.</p>

<p>It is needless to say anything here about
the doctrines of the Greek Church: every
one knows the insignificant differences which
separate it from the Church of Rome. The
rites are less generally known; but unfortunately
they are too numerous and various to
be described here. The general impression
produced by a Greek service is gorgeousness.
The rites are essentially Oriental, and have
been little changed since the early days of
the Eastern Empire. The ceremonies are
endless; fast and feast days, with their distinctive
rites, are always occurring, and
though generally disregarded by the upper
classes are scrupulously observed by the
peasantry, to whom the fasts (on which they
work as usual) cause actual physical injury,
and the feasts sometimes produce almost
equally disastrous effects. Some parts of the
service are very beautiful and impressive;
but the prayers are generally intoned in a
hurried and irreverent manner, which renders
them hard to be understood. These things,
however, are mending: the lower clergy pay
more attention to the ordinary rules of decorum
in the conduct of the services, and bishops
are now not consecrated unless they are
somewhat educated. Formerly the lives of
the saints were the topics of sermons, now
they are becoming more practical and exhortatory;
but political subjects are strictly
excluded.</p>

<p>Since the conquest the Greek Church and
its clergy in the Ottoman Empire have never
been supported by the Government, nor have
its ministers ever received any grant either
for themselves or the churches and schools
under their care. An imperial order confirms
the nomination of patriarchs, metropolitans,
archbishops, and bishops. The last
received from each family in their diocese a
portion of the produce of its fields: from a
peasant, for example, from half a kilo of corn
and hay to a whole kilo, according to his
means. This was considered a loyal donation
from each household to its spiritual
guide. Besides this the archbishops enjoyed
special benefits from the celebration of marriages,
funerals, and other religious ceremonies
to which they were invited. But unfortunately
these emoluments eventually became
subject to some abuses, which excited
murmurs from the community. Another
custom was that a bishop should receive
from his diocese, at his consecration, a sum
sufficient to defray his immediate expenses
during the first year. This sum, as well as
the offerings in kind, was fixed by the elders
of the town in which the metropolitan resided;
the local authorities never interfered
in these arrangements, except when the
bishops demanded their assistance for the recovery
of their dues. These usages continued
in force until 1860; Feizi Pasha and his two
supporters, Ali Pasha and Fouad Pasha, had
previously tried every means to induce the
Patriarch of Constantinople and his Synod,
together with the higher classes of the Greek
nation, to accept the funds of their church
from the Ottoman Government. The Porte,
in order to obtain the end it had in view,
showed itself liberal by promising large fees
to the higher clergy. But for religious, political,
and social reasons, the patriarch and
the nation in general rejected the proposal.
After the Crimean War a Constitutional
Assembly, composed of bishops and lay deputies
from all the provinces, was convened
by order of the Porte, to deliberate upon the
settlement of some administrative affairs
connected with the œcumenical throne of
Constantinople, the cathedrals, and the
bishops. This assembly also regulated,
among other things, the revenues of the
patriarch and all the archbishops. Each
province, proportionately to its extent, its
political importance, and its Christian population,
was ordered to pay a fixed sum. The
annual minimum is 30,000 piastres, and the
maximum 90,000 piastres. The patriarch
receives thirty per cent on this. The fees
fixed by the elders of each province are paid
annually by each family: the maximum of
this contribution does not exceed twenty
piastres each, which, in the aggregate, constitutes
the revenues of the bishops and the
pay of their subordinates. The extra revenues
are regulated in the same manner, the
ancient customs concerning their receipt having
been abolished. The fees and extra
emoluments of the lower clergy of cities,
towns, and villages are received after the
same fashion. An annual sum is paid by
each family to the priest, which in many
villages rarely exceeds three or four piastres.
The archbishops also receive their stipend
from their diocese, and are very seldom
obliged to request the assistance of the
authorities, who show great repugnance to
interfering in the matter.</p>

<p>The social influence of a bishop proceeds
from many circumstances. He is considered
the spiritual guide of all Orthodox Christians,
presiding over the vestry and corporation
intrusted with public affairs—such as
schools, philanthropical establishments, and
churches. He hears and judges, conjointly
with a council composed of laymen, all the
dissensions which arise between the members
of the community. To a certain extent,
and when there is no intervention of the local
courts, he judges in cases of divorce, and in
disputes relative to the payment of dowries,
as well as in cases of inheritance; but the
local courts have the right of interfering. In
these cases the canonical laws are more or
less well interpreted according to the pleasure
of the Kadi. The bishop judges all that relates
to the aforesaid cases in right of a privilege
granted to him by the patriarch. He
can also decide other matters which belong
to the local courts in a friendly way when
the disputants agree to it; but when one of
them appears dissatisfied he may refer it to
the local court, and the sentence or the bishop
is nullified by that of this tribunal.</p>

<p>The bishop enjoys the political position of
Ἐθνάρχη and permanent member of the Government
Council of the province. In addition
to his spiritual duties, in the fulfilment
of which he has sometimes to call in the assistance
of the local authorities, the bishop
acts as intermediary between the Christians
and the civil government when they ask for
his intervention and counsel. But this is
not always successful, as the bishop is invested
with no regular power, and the local
authorities, as well as the central administration,
make use of it as they choose and when
convenient to them, always acting for the direct
interest of their government.</p>

<p>In the Council the influence of the bishop
is <i>nil</i>; for his vote, as well as those of all the
other Christian members, is lost in the majority
gained by the Mussulmans, to which
is added the arbitrary influence of the Pasha
and the President. Very small benefit is derived
from the presence of these Christian
representatives at the councils. Liberty of
speech, reasonable discussion, and all that
might contribute to the proper direction of
affairs, are entirely unknown.</p>

<p>The Greek Church is governed by four
patriarchs residing at Constantinople, Jerusalem,
Antioch, and Alexandria; the last
three are equal and independent, but the
authority of the first is supreme in the regulation
of spiritual affairs, and in his hands
rests the power of appointing, dismissing, or
punishing any of the prelates. He is elected
by a majority of votes of a synod of the metropolitan
and neighboring bishops, and is presented
to the Sultan for institution, a favor
seldom obtained without the payment of
several thousand pounds—a long-standing
instance of the habitual simony of the
Church. The Sultan, however, retains the
unmitigated power of deposing, banishing,
or executing him. These penalties were frequently
inflicted in former times, but the
ecclesiastical body within the last half century
has gained much in influence and substance.</p>

<p>In spite of the general ignorance and corruption
of the higher clergy since the occupation
of the country by the Ottomans, their
ranks have never lacked men who were as
famous for their knowledge as for their virtue
and piety. There were many who shunned
ecclesiastical dignity in order to pass their
lives in instructing the rising generation of
their time.</p>

<p>No religious schools then existed: the ecclesiastics
received their elementary education
in the Ottoman establishments, and were
subsequently sent to the colleges of Germany
or Italy to complete their studies. It was
only about the year 1843 that the first school
for the teaching of theology was founded in
the island of Chalcis, so that most of the
present archbishops in the Empire studied
there; but many priests still go to Athens to
complete their education. Schools were also
established for the lower clergy, but the
teaching in them was so deficient that most
of the priests were sent to study only in the
national schools, where they learn next to
nothing.</p>

<p>The higher ranks of the clergy are entirely
recruited from the monastic order: hence
they are always unmarried, and hence the
too often vicious character of their lives. An
attempt, partly successful, was made to put
some check upon their conduct by the law
that no bishop or archbishop can hold more
than three sees during his lifetime. If,
therefore, he scandalizes the population of
two dioceses, he is at least bound to be prudent
in the third.</p>

<p>No distinction exists between the priests of
the cities and those of the country villages.
All are equal; nominated and elected in the
same manner; remunerated for their services
after the mode already explained.
Nearly all of them are married; but those
who are not stand on the same footing as
those who are. Historically, these parish
priests have done some service to the Greek
nation: they helped to remind it of its national
existence, and by their simple, hard-working
lives taught their flocks that the
Greeks had still a church that was not wholly
given over to cringing to the Turks, that
had not altogether bowed the knee to Baal.
But that is all that can be said for them. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
is impossible to conceive a clergy more ignorant
than these parish priests; they are not
only absolutely without training in their own
profession, knowing nought of theology, but
they have not a common elementary education.
If, on the one hand, this ignorance
puts them more on a sympathetic level with
their parishioners, it must not be forgotten
that it renders them incapable of raising
their flocks one jot above the stage of rustic
barbarism in which they found them. There
is no ambition (unlike the rest of the Greek
race) in these homely priests; for they cannot
attain any high position in the Church.
Their association seldom benefits the people
with much religious instruction, for their
studies are restricted to the external formalities
of their services. Many of the abuses
attributed to them for exactions are exaggerated:
their condition of poverty and modest
way of living, in no way superior to the
common people, is the best proof of this fact.
They are accused of bargaining for the price
of performing certain rites, but any abuse of
the kind can be prevented by consulting the
established table of fees for all such matters;
so that this infringement cannot be carried on
to any great extent.</p>

<p>There is no manner of doubt that the only
hope for the Orthodox Church lies in its separation
from Moslem government. So long
as its high dignitaries have to purchase their
appointments from Turkish ministers and
Sultans, so long will it retain its character
for truckling and corruption, so long will it
lack the one thing needful in a church—moral
force. Not less are the lower clergy
affected by this unhappy connection between
church and state. The government
puts every obstacle in the way of the establishment
of schools for priests: it is aware
that its influence over the mass of the clergy
can last only so long as that clergy is
ignorant and knows not the energy for
freedom which education must bring. Let
the Church be severed from the control of the
Porte, let it be assured of the integrity of the
Greek nation, and the end of the necessity for
conciliating the Turks, and then we may
hope for reforms—for the regeneration of the
priesthood and the destruction of the web of
deadly superstition which it has so long
found profitable to weave round the hearts of
the people.</p>

<p>Any account, however brief, of the Greek
church would be very incomplete without
some notice of the monasteries which the
traveller sees scattered over the country in
the most beautiful and commanding positions,
perched on the summit of precipitous
rocks, on the steep slopes of hills, or nestled
in the shady seclusion of the glens. The
most renowned are the twenty monasteries
of Mount Athos, called Ἅγιος Ὄρος, or
Monte Santo. The population of this peninsula
is quite unique of its kind. The community
of monks is divided into five classes.
The first comprises those who are as it were
independent, and are subjected to no severe
rules. It is impossible for a man without
fortune to live in these monasteries, because
the common fund provides only the rations
of bread, wine, oil, etc. Every other outlay
in the way of dress or the choice of better
food is at his own expense. Each prepares
his meals in his cell and need not fast unless
he chooses, but cannot indulge in meat, as
its use is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>Eight monasteries are called independent
(Idiorrhythmic), on account of the manner
in which their occupants live. The greatest
of these and the first founded is Μεγίστη
Λαὺρα, or Great Lavra: and the others are
Xeropotamu, Docheiareiu, Pantokratoros,
Stavroniketa, Philotheu, Iveron, and Vatopedi.
But these monasteries occasionally
change their <i>régime</i> from the stricter to the
laxer discipline, or again from the Idiorrhythmic
to the Cenobite.</p>

<p>The second category comprises the monasteries
in which the recluses live in common.
This life, which is one of great austerity, was
founded by the organizers of the religious
orders of the Orthodox Church, and represents,
as nearly as possible, the rule of the
ascetics of ancient times. Community of
goods is the regulation in these convents: all
is equal, frugal, and simple. There is but
one treasury, one uniform, one table, one
class of food, and the discipline is very rigid.
Whoever wishes to enter one of these monastic
establishments must give all that he possesses
in the way of money or raiment to the
Father Superior or chief elected by the members
of the institution. The neophyte is submitted
to a year’s noviciate; and if, during
this time, he can bear the life, he is admitted
into the order and consecrated a monk. If,
on the contrary, the rigid and austere life disheartens
him, he is allowed to retire. Each
monk possesses a camp-bed in his cell, besides
a jug of water and his clothing; but he
is strictly forbidden, under pain of severe
ecclesiastical punishment, to have money or
any kind of food, or even the utensils necessary
for making coffee.</p>

<p>Should a monk find some object on his
path, he is obliged to deliver it to the Father
Superior, to whom he ought to carry all his
sufferings, physical and moral, in order to
receive consolation and relief. Every monk
belonging to this order must, without shrinking,
execute the commands of the Father
Superior concerning the exterior and interior
affairs of the monastery. One third of the
night is consecrated to prayer in the principal
church, where all the brotherhood are
expected to attend, with the exception of
the sick and infirm. The ritual of prayers is
the same as in all the monasteries of Mount
Athos, except those of the communal ascetics.
Vigils are very frequent, the prayers commencing
at sunset and continuing till sunrise.</p>

<p>The following may be mentioned as belonging
to this class: St. Paul, St. Dionysius,
St. Gregory, St. Simopetra, and St.
Panteleemon, called the Russian monasteries
on account of their being principally
inhabited by Russian and Greek monks.
Xenophu, Konstamonitu, and Zographu, are
inhabited by Bulgarian monks, and Chilandari
by Bulgarians and Servians. The other
monasteries are Sphigmenu, Karakallu, and
Kutlumusi.</p>

<p>The third category is composed of monks
who live in solitude. Their rules resemble
those already described, but they may be
considered to lead a life of still greater austerity.
Their groups of small houses, which
contain two or three little rooms and a
chapel, are called sketés (σκητή); they are
surrounded by gardens of about an acre in
extent. In the midst of these groups of,
buildings is a church called Κυριακόν, where
mass is celebrated on Sundays and feast-days,
at which service all the monks are expected
to be present; on other days they
perform their devotions in their own chapels.
In each of these habitations two or three
monks lead a very frugal life; their food
consists of fresh or dry vegetables, which can
only be prepared with oil on Saturday and
Sunday, when they are allowed to eat fish,
but very seldom eggs or cheese. The inhabitants
of the σκητή support themselves entirely
by their manual labor; each monk is required
to follow some trade by which he can
earn sufficient for his food and clothing.
This consists mostly in the manufacture of
cowls, stockings, and other articles of dress,
which are sold in the neighborhood; with
the addition of carvings in wood in the shape
of crosses, spoons, etc., with which a small
commerce is carried on with the pilgrims
that visit the peninsula. Each σκητή ought
to go to Karias once a year, where a fair is
held, to sell his wares, and with the proceeds
buy his supply of food. There are a great
many monks who, with the exception of this
annual journey, go nowhere, and possess not
the remotest idea of what is passing in the
world outside the restricted limits of their
mountain. On the whole, their life is a time
of continual toil in order to procure what is
strictly necessary for their support, and of
endless prayer for the eternal welfare of their
souls.</p>

<p>The fourth category comprises the recluses
known as Κελλιώται. Their pretty houses are
sometimes sufficiently spacious and kept in
good order. Each contains from four to five
rooms and a chapel, besides possessing large
extents of garden planted with vines, and
olive and nut trees. These dwellings are tenanted
by five or six recluses, and belong to
convents that sell them to the monks. But
the right of possession is not complete, as the
purchasers are subjected to the payment of a
small rent, and are not allowed to transfer
their purchase to other persons without the
consent of the monastery. The buyer, being
the chief of those who live with him, considers
them his servants or subordinates, and
they can acquire no privileges without long
years of service. The Superior may inscribe
the names of two other persons on the title-deeds,
who succeed according to their order
in the hierarchy. Such property is never
made over to persons of different religions,
the law on this point being very strict. A
new regulation is, that no Greek monastery
should be granted to foreigners, such as
Russians, Bulgarians, Servians, or Wallachians;
as they, being richer than the Greeks,
might easily make themselves masters of the
whole.</p>

<p>The recluses live on the produce of their
lands and seldom by the labor of their hands.
Many among them have amassed a little fortune
by the sale of their oil, wine, and nuts.
Their mode of living and their food and
clothing are the same as in the other monasteries;
their ritual is also similar, with the
exception that their devotions are performed
with more brevity.</p>

<p>Take away their solitary life and their continual
prayers, and they then might be considered
as industrial companies belonging to
the world.</p>

<p>The fifth category comprises the anchorites,
whose rules are the most sublime and
severe. These holy men do not work, but
pass their time in prayer, the hard earth
serves for their bed, and a stone for their
pillow; their raiment consists only of a few
rags.</p>

<p>Never quitting their grottoes, they pass
their days and nights in prayer; their food
is always dry bread, with fresh water once a
week. If the abode of the anchorite be situated
in an inaccessible spot, he lets down a
basket, into which the passers-by throw the
bread which is his sole nourishment. Others
have friends in some distant monastery, who
alone know the secret of their retreat and
bring them provisions. These solitary
beings shun the sight and sound of man,
their life having for its sole object the mortification
of the flesh, meditation, and prayer.
The population of Mount Athos is estimated
at between six and seven thousand souls, two-thirds
of whom are Greeks from different
parts of the Ottoman empire, and the other
third Russians, Bulgarians, and Servians.
Their government is a representative assembly
in which deputies from the twenty monasteries
take part, except the σκητή and the
κελλιώται, who are dependants of the others.
The twenty monasteries are divided into four
parts, which are again subdivided into five.
Each year a representative from each division
is called upon to take part in the government
of the peninsula. Their duties consist principally
in superintending the police and the
administration of justice. These four governors
are called <i>nazarides</i>, a Turkish word
which signifies inspectors.</p>

<p>Twice a year regularly, and each time a
serious case occurs, a kind of parliament is
called, consisting of the twenty deputies,
who, with the four nazarides, occupy themselves
with current affairs and common
wants. Each monastery acts independently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of the others in the administration of its
affairs. The chief inspector, judge, and
spiritual chief, who decides all disputes that
arise in the monasteries is the Patriarch of
Constantinople. The authority of the Turkish
government is represented by a Kaimakam,
who acts as intermediary between the
parliament and the Porte; he fulfils rather
the duties of a superintendent than that of
a governor. There is also a custom-house
officer to watch over the importations and
exportations of “The Holy Mountain.”</p>

<p>Some of the monasteries contain fine libraries
and rich church ornaments, which are
the only wealth they possess. Each convent
is under the protection of a patron saint, who
is generally represented by some λείψανα, or
relics. The anniversaries of these patron
saints are held in great veneration by the
Greeks, crowds resorting to the convents to
celebrate them. Caravans may be seen
wending their way along the mountain paths
leading to the convent, some mounted on
horses or mules, some on foot, while dozens
of small heads may be seen peeping above
the brims of large panniers carried by horses.
On entering the church attached to the edifice
the pilgrims light tapers, which they
deposit before the shrine of the tutelar saint,
cross themselves repeatedly, and then join
the rest of the company in dedicating the
evening to feasting and merry-making.
These gatherings, though blamable perhaps
as being occasioned by superstitious rites, are
otherwise harmless, and even beneficial to the
masses; to the townspeople in the break in
their sedentary habits, and to the country-people
in introducing among them more enlightened
and liberal ideas, and in facilitating
social intercourse between them in these Arcadian
gatherings under the shade of spreading
plane-trees, and stimulated by the circulation
of the wine-cup. I have often visited
these Panaghias and experienced real pleasure
in witnessing the happy gambols of the children
and the gay dances and songs executed
by the young people, and in listening to the
conversation or those of more mature years.
At meal times all the assembled company
unite in an immense picnic, feasting to their
hearts’ content on the good fare with which
they come provided, and to the special profit
of the numerous hawkers of “<i>scimitiers</i>,”
“<i>petas</i>,” parched peas, popped corn, stale
sugar-plums, gum mastic, fruits, flowers,
little looking-glasses, rouge, etc.; the last two
articles for the benefit of the young beauties,
who may be found adding to their charms
hidden behind the trunk of a tree. The
merriment is kept up to a late hour, and at
dawn the slumberers are awakened by the
sound of the monastery bell calling them to
mass. This is generally read by the Egumenos,
or Prior, except when the bishop of the
diocese is invited to celebrate it, in which
case the ceremony is naturally more imposing
and the expenses incurred by the community
increased to a slight extent. Money,
however, is not extorted from the worshippers,
each individual giving to the monastery
according to his means and his feelings of devotion.
Kind and open hospitality is afforded
to all by the good monks, whose retired and
simple mode of life receives no variety but
from these gatherings.</p>

<p>Women and animals of the feminine gender
are not allowed to enter the precincts of
the “Holy Mountain.” This prohibition
seems to be in some way connected with the
curiosity of Lot’s wife, whose punishment is
expected to befall the adventurous daughter
of Eve who should thus transgress. This
superstition has, however, lost much of its
force since Lady Stratford’s visit to the monasteries
during the Crimean War, when some
of the monks tremblingly watched for the
transformation, till they had the satisfaction
of seeing her Ladyship quit the dangerous
precincts in the full possession of the graces
that characterized her.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether the adoption
of the Orthodox Creed by the Bulgarians has
been a blessing or a curse to them; for the
friendly union that sprang up from the assimilation
of faith between the two rival nations
was not of long duration. Their amicable
relations were often disturbed by jealousies,
in the settlement of which Christianity
was often used as a cloak to cover
many ugly sins on both sides, and its true
spirit was seldom allowed free scope for its
sublime mission of peace, light, and charity.
Religion was the subject that occupied, after
the Crimean War, the minds of the small enlightened
class of the modern Bulgarians,
spread over all parts of Bulgaria, but existing
in greater numbers in the eyalet of Philippopolis,
where the honest, wealthy, and educated
men who had in foreign lands imbibed
the progressive ideas of the day, raised their
voices against the then subjected condition of
their church to that of Constantinople, and
put forward a just claim for its separation or
independence. As already mentioned, the religious
ties existing between the Greeks and
Bulgarians do not appear at any time to have
formed a bond of union between the two nations,
or promoted social or friendly feelings
among them. After the Turkish conquest,
Bulgarians and Greeks, crushed by the same
blow, ceased their animosity; but bore in
mind that one was to serve in promoting Panslavistic
interests, and the other those of Panhellenism.
The proximity of these two distinct
elements, and the mixture of the one
people with the other by their geographical
position, render the two extremely diffident
of each other and jealously careful of their
own interests, although direct and open action
on either side has not been prominent.</p>

<p>The Bulgarians, during the 13th century,
had separated themselves from the Church of
Constantinople. This was a serious measure
which the mother church naturally resented
and used every means in her power to abolish.
In this she finally succeeded in 1767,
when the Bulgarian Church was once more
placed under the immediate spiritual jurisdiction
of the See of Constantinople. The
Bulgarian bishops were dismissed and their
dioceses transferred to Greeks, the monasteries
seized and their revenues applied to
the Greek Church. This was doubtless an
unjust blow which the nation never forgot,
nor did they cease to reproach the Greeks
with the injury done to them. The latter
had, no doubt, a double interest in the act,
and the first and less worthy was the material
profit the clergy and Greek communities
obtained by the appropriation of the Bulgarian
Church revenues. The second was a
strong political motive; for the right of possessing
an independent Bulgarian Church
and cultivating the Bulgarian language
meant nothing less than raising and developing
the future organ of Panslavism in districts
the Greeks consider they have a hereditary
right to; their national interests were,
in fact, at stake. The men to whom was
intrusted the duty of protecting these interests
were unscrupulous as to the means they
used in the fulfilment of their task, and a
perpetual struggle ensued, resulting in persecution
and other crimes besides the unjust
dealing with which the Bulgarians charge
their rivals. Both parties, from their own
point of view, are right; and there is nothing
for them but to keep up the conflict till
some decisive victory, or perhaps arbitration,
settles the dispute.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian Church question re-commenced
in 1858 and lasted until 1872, during
which time the bitter strife was renewed between
the two nations, inducing the Bulgarians
to demand from the Porte the fulfilment
of the promises made in decreed reforms to
guarantee liberty of religious worship and the
church reforms indicated in the Hatti-scherif
of Gulhané.</p>

<p>These demands were just and reasonable,
and at first limited to the request that the
Porte would grant permission that Bulgarians,
or at least men capable of speaking
their language, should alone be appointed
bishops; that the service in their churches,
instead of being performed in the ancient
Greek, a tongue unknown to the Bulgarians,
should be performed in the native language,
and other similar demands, which the Greek
patriarch very unwisely refused to listen to.
Previously to this, in 1851, the Porte had
obliged the patriarch to consecrate a Bulgarian
bishop.</p>

<p>In a church which the Bulgarians had
erected by permission of the Porte at Constantinople,
in 1860, during the celebration
of Easter, the Bulgarian bishop, at the request
of the congregation, omitted from the
customary prayer the name of the patriarch.
This was the first decisive step towards the
accomplishment of the schism that took place
subsequently. The example set by this bishop
was followed in many parts of Bulgaria;
occasionally the name of the Sultan was substituted
for that of the patriarch. The excitement
this movement caused in Bulgaria was
intense, and acted upon the dormant minds
of the people with a force that pushed them
at least ten years in advance of what they
had been, and opened their eyes to things
they had failed previously to observe.</p>

<p>The Porte, alarmed by this sudden effervescence
of public feeling in Bulgaria, despatched
the Grand Vizir on a tour in that
country to study the feeling of the people.
At his approach the inhabitants of every
town flocked to his presence and brought
their grievances under his notice. The Vizir’s
action was as just and impartial as circumstances
would allow; he listened to the
grievances of the people, righted many of
their wrongs, imprisoned some officials and
dismissed others; but, notwithstanding, the
Bulgarians failed to obtain on this occasion
any great material amelioration either of their
condition or with regard to the Church question.</p>

<p>At this stage all true Bulgarians, including
those of the rural districts, were fully
aroused; and, reminded by their respective
chieftains, or heads of communities, of the
importance of the pending question, and the
necessity of united action, they determined
to fight the battle with the patriarch and
overcome the opposition they continued to
meet with from that quarter. Help of any
description was desirable for them, and even
foreign agency was prudently courted. The
Porte was given to understand that it possessed
no subjects more faithful and devoted
than the Bulgarians, and that the rights they
demanded could be only obtained from it,
and if their Sultan decided in their favor he
would secure their eternal gratitude and devotion.
Rome began to take an interest in
the matter, and the Government of Napoleon
III., stimulated by the Uniate Propaganda,
headed by some Polish dignitaries established
in Paris, endeavored to secure a hold upon
the people by means of the priests and agents
sent into Bulgaria, and people were made to
believe that the whole of Bulgaria was ready
to adopt Roman Catholicism and place itself
under the protection of France. (See the next
chapter.)</p>

<p>Russia, alarmed by these rumors, also began
to show signs of active interest in the
matter, and by her promises of assistance,
her efforts to counteract the Uniate movement,
and the pressure she finally began to
enforce upon the Porte in favor of the Bulgarian
church movement, ended in gaining to
her side a small but influential body of Bulgarians
in the Danubian districts. There
was a critical moment when the Bulgarians,
thinking all was lost for them, turned their
hopes and even appealed to England for help,
promising that if this were granted they
would become Protestants. The missionaries
of the Evangelical and other Protestant
societies were led to believe in the possibility
of such a conversion, and became doubly
zealous in their efforts to enlighten the people.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
In the midst of this conflicting state of
affairs, when each party tried to enforce its
own views and derive the most profit, the
church of Constantinople remained inflexible,
the Porte took to compromising, and the
Bulgarians, doggedly and steadily working
on, by degrees became more venturesome in
their action, more pressing in their demands,
and more independent in their proceedings.
Greek bishops were ejected from their dioceses
in Bulgaria and driven away by the
people. In Nish and other places monasteries
were seized, and their incomes reappropriated
by the Bulgarian communities. Personal
encounters and struggles of a strangely
unchristian nature were frequent between the
contending parties, sometimes taking place
even within the precincts of the churches.
The struggle for independence continued, in
spite of the anathemas hurled against the
Bulgarians by the Patriarchate, and was encouraged
by the desertion of two Bishops to
their side. The exile of these by the Porte,
at the instigation of the Patriarch, and a variety
of other incidents ensued, until in 1868
Fouad and Ali Pashas took up the Bulgarian
cause, and the exiled Bishops were recalled
(February 28th, 1870).</p>

<p>Through the instrumentality of the latter a
Firman was issued constituting a Bulgarian
Exarch, and permission was given to the Bulgarians
to elect their spiritual chief, the election
to be confirmed by a Berat of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Ali Pasha’s death, however, in 1871, caused
new difficulties, and the enforcement of this
measure was, under different pretexts, delayed
during the ministry of his successor,
Mahmoud Pasha, and ultimately only fulfilled
in consequence of the proportions the
question had assumed, and the active interest
taken in it by Russia as shown in the policy
of General Ignatieff. This policy was
not approved of by the majority of thinking
Bulgarians, who, with good reason, dreaded
the consequences of Russian influence based
on the solid assistance it had rendered to the
Bulgarian church. Russia from all times
has made use of the churches and monasteries
in Bulgaria, largely endowing them with
sacerdotal gifts, in order to consolidate her
influence and gain the faith and confidence
of the people.</p>

<p>All now is confusion, darkness, and uncertainty
in Bulgaria. Their churches, inaugurated
with so much hope and confidence,
have been polluted with every crime and
stained with the blood of innumerable victims.
Centuries must pass before the wrongs
and misfortunes of late years can be forgotten
by this unhappy people.</p>

<p>There is yet another Christian Church in
Turkey which must have a place in this
chapter. St. Gregory the Illuminator, the
patron saint of Armenia, is looked upon as
the effective bearer of that heavenly light
that was to extinguish the beacons of the
fire-worshippers and found the Armenian
Church. In the beginning of the fourth century
of our era this saint preached in court
of Tiridates, who, evidently little disposed at
the time to accept the new faith, vented his
ill-humor against it by ordering the martyrdom
of its preacher. The most agonizing
tortures, say the Armenian annals, inflicted
upon St. Gregory failed in the desired effect.
Finally, after having been made to walk on
pointed nails, and having melted lead poured
down his throat, he was cast into a cistern,
among snakes and scorpions, where he lived
fourteen years, daily fed by an angel, who
brought him bread and water. At the end
of this period he was allowed to issue from
his dismal abode, and was called upon to
baptize the penitent king and his nobles, converted
through the instrumentality of the
king’s sister, to whom the Christian religion
was revealed in a vision. Such is the legendary
origin of Christianity in Armenia. The
new faith enforced by royalty was soon
spread through the country. St. Gregory
was appointed Patriarch of Armenia, and
after creating a number of churches, bishoprics,
and convents, and regulating the canons
of each, he retired into the solitude of a hermitage,
where he was put to death by order
of the king’s son. It was the beginning of a
long course of misfortunes. There is something
grand in the sacrifice that the ignorant
and stout-hearted Asiatics made in the cause
of religion. Nowhere was persecution so
long or so cruel, martyrdoms so terrible,
self-denial so complete as among the people
of the land where the human race is fabled
to have had its origin.</p>

<p>St. Gregory was succeeded in the Patriarchal
chair by his son Aristogus, who, having
taken part in the Council of Nice in 335
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, brought back with him some of its decrees,
and caused the first schism in the
church. The terrible religious dissensions
that raged for so many centuries made themselves
as deeply felt in Armenia as elsewhere.
Every dogma of Christianity was in turn examined,
adopted, or rejected, until the Monophysitic
views, gaining the majority of the
people, caused the schism that finally separated
the Armenian from the primitive
church.</p>

<p>The two parties, though differing but
slightly from each other, cease not, even to
the present day, their antagonism. The
schismatics affirm the absorption of the human
nature of Christ into the Divine—the
procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father
alone—redemption from original sin by
the sacrifice of Christ, redemption from actual
sin by auricular confession and penance.
They adhere to the seven sacraments, perform
baptism by trine immersion, believe in
the mediation of saints, the adoration of pictures,
and transubstantiation, and administer
the sacrament in both kinds to laymen; they
deny purgatorial penance and yet invoke the
prayers of the pious for the benefit of the
souls of the departed.</p>

<p>The Armenian Church differs from the Latin
in seven points. Its doctrine is contained
in the following formula, which the candidates
for priestly office are obliged to profess
before ordination: “We believe in Jesus
Christ, one person and a double nature, and
in conformity with the Holy Fathers we reject
and detest the Council of Chalcedon, the
letter of St. Leon to Flavian; we say anathema
to every sect that denies the two natures.”</p>

<p>In Church polity, after long quarrels and
bickerings between three patriarchs, each
following his own interest, rivalries, and rites,
the supremacy has at last been vested in one
who is called Catholicos, chosen from among
the Armenian archbishops and appointed by
the Emperor of Russia. The seat of the
Patriarchate is the famous convent of Echmiadzin
at Erivan, in Russian territory.
This convent contains a magnificent library,
is extremely wealthy, and exercises supreme
power over the others in spiritual matters.
It alone has the right to ordain archbishops
to the forty-two archbishoprics under its
control, and to settle points of dogma.
Among the pretended relics it possesses are
the dead hand of St. Gregory, used for consecrating
his successors in the Patriarchate,
and the lance with which Christ was pierced.
This convent of Echmiadzin is to the Armenians
what Mount Athos has been to the
Greeks. In both, Russia has spared neither
expense nor effort to establish her influence
and spread it by means of these channels all
over the Christian populations of the East.
Her too stirring policy at Mount Athos, as
shown by the publication of “Les Responsabilités,”
and her attempt to enforce upon the
Catholicos of Echmiadzin the decree for the
suppression of the Armenian language in the
churches and schools, and replacing it by
Russian, had an equally unfortunate result.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Russian Government to
improve the condition of this country are
said to have met with a certain amount of
success; commerce and industry, encouraged
by the creation of roads and other facilities,
have been the principal temptations held out
to emigrants from Turkish territory. Of all
the European powers Russia alone could help
to civilize and improve the degraded condition
of the Christians of those distant regions.
Her influence would have been stronger and
more beneficial to them if her policy had
been a more straightforward and liberal one,
and more in accordance with the national
rights of the people whose good-will and confidence
she will fail to secure so long as she
follows the old system of trying to Russianize
them by the suppression of their privileges.</p>

<p>The Armenian churches are not unlike
those of the Greeks; they are similar in decoration—pictures
of Christ, the Virgin, and
the saints being the principal ornaments of
their altars. These pictures are slightly superior
to the expressionless ones used by the
Greeks. The pious often decorate parts of
these with a silver or gold coating on the
hands, or as an aureole, and sometimes over
the whole body. The Armenians have faith
in the efficacy of prayers addressed to these
images, as well as in the laying of hands on
the sick or distressed, who are often taken to
the church and left through the night before
the altar of some special saint. The Armenian
patriarchs and bishops enjoy the same
rights and privileges as the Greeks, and administer
justice to their respective communities
on the same conditions.</p>

<p>Like the Greek, the Armenian clergy are of
two orders, secular and monastic; the former
are allowed to marry, but never occupy
a high position in the church. They are
usually very poor, even poorer and more retired
than the Greek parish priests, living
like the lower orders of the people, who look
upon them as their friends. Although ignorant,
they are much respected for the morality
of their lives, but knowing nothing more
than the routine of their office they are unable
to give any religious instruction to their
parishioners beyond that contained in the
books of prayer used in the church; a passage
from the lives or writings of the saints is
read in place of a sermon.</p>

<p>This drawback to the propagation of more
practical religion is being by degrees removed
since the introduction of excellent religious
books published by the Mechitarist College
at Venice, and by the American Missionary
societies. The latter especially have done
much to stimulate the dormant spirit of inquiry;
the large circulation of Bibles, which
by their low price are brought within the
reach of all, encourages the propensity shown
by the Armenians to admit Protestant ideas,
which are being daily more extensively
spread among the community. “In Central
Turkey alone there are now no less than
twenty-six organized churches, with some
2500 members, and audiences amounting in
the aggregate to 5000 or 6000 steady attendants.”</p>

<p>From the time of the Ottoman conquest
spiritual liberty has been allowed to all creeds
in Turkey, and the external observances and
ceremonies of religion have, in most places,
been permitted by the Moslems, though in
some even funeral ceremonies were often
molested, and the use of church bells was
forbidden. Certain rights and privileges
were granted to each church, to which the
Christians clung with great tenacity—as to a
sacred banner, round which they would one
day rally and march to freedom.</p>

<p>By the concessions granted to the vanquished
by their conquerors, they were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
to retain those churches that had escaped
destruction or were not converted into
mosques, and permitted to worship according
to the dictates of their own consciences
so long as the sound of their bell calling the
infidels to prayer did not offend the ear of
the faithful. The internal administration
was not interfered with; each congregation
was free to choose its own clergy, ornament
the interior of its church as it saw fit, perform
its pilgrimages and bury its dead, without
interference from the authorities. These
privileges, though looked upon as sacred by
the poor, could not compensate in the sight
of the rich and once powerful for social and
material losses; thus many Christians renounced
their faith and adopted that of their
masters.</p>

<p>Time and succeeding events have softened
down some of the outstanding wrongs; fanatical
outbreaks and religious persecutions
have become of less frequent occurrence;
and the various Hattis proclaiming freedom
of worship and religious equality to all Ottoman
subjects before the law, are guarantees
that no arbitrary action on the part of the
government can interfere with the religious
privileges of the Christians, or deprive them
of their rights. Though this guarantee is a
proof of the sincerity of the Porte in its
efforts to give satisfaction to its Christian
subjects, it cannot remove the evil or lessen
its consequences, which remain in all their
force of danger and uncertainty. Every
movement of discontent in Turkey receives a
strong impulse from that religious zeal which
stimulates the Mohammedan to acts of fanatical
barbarity, and the Christian to a superstitious
belief in miraculous powers that will
protect him in the hour of danger. Thus, in
times of disturbance the timorous bulk of the
population of a town or village will rush to
the church for safety, there pouring out mingled
prayers and tears to God and all the
saints that the threatened danger may be
averted. Rarely, it would seem, are such
prayers heard, for the first place to which
the excited Mussulman rushes is the church,
and thither the brigand chief will lead his
band, and perpetrate acts of the most revolting
barbarity. The armed peasant, the undisciplined
soldier, or the cruel and licentious
Bashi-Bazouk will all attack the sacred edifice,
break it open, and destroy or pollute all
that falls into their hands. These are the
ever-recurring evils that no Imperial law will
be able to prevent, no measures eradicate, so
long as the two rival creeds continue to exist
face to face, and be used as the principal motives
in the struggle, past and present, for
supremacy on one side, freedom and independence
on the other. The Mussulmans,
under pressure, will grant every concession
demanded of them, and to a great extent
carry them out; but it would be utterly erroneous
to suppose for a moment that under
any pressure or in any degree of civilization,
the Turk would be able to disabuse himself
of the deeply-rooted disdain the most liberal-minded
of his race feels for strangers to his
creed and nation.</p>

<p>The experiences of all thoroughly acquainted
with the character of the Ottoman tallies
with mine on this point. I have seen the
disdain felt by the Mohammedan towards
the Christian portrayed on the faces of the
most liberal, virtuous, and well-disposed, as
well as on those of the most bigoted. A
Christian, be he European or Asiatic, is an infidel
in the Moslem’s sight. He will receive
him graciously, converse with him in the
most amicable manner, and at the same time
mumble prayers for pardon for his sin in
holding communication with an unbeliever.</p>

<p>The religious freedom enjoyed by the members
of the Protestant and Roman Catholic
churches is far more extensive than that enjoyed
by the Eastern. Both, upheld by the
powerful support of European powers, enjoy a
liberty of action and license of speech rarely
found in other countries. Both are aliens and
owe their origin to the proselytizing efforts
of the missionaries. The Church of Rome,
being the older and more enterprising, naturally
commands a much vaster field than the
Protestant; she is supported by France and
other Roman Catholic countries, who jealously
watch over her rights and privileges.
The Protestants are protected by England
and America; their missionaries entered Turkey
at a later date and gradually established
themselves over the country. At first
the extremely reserved attitude of the missionaries,
their conscientious method of making
converts, and the extreme severity of
their regulations, gave them but a poor
chance of success. Gradually, however, the
esteem and regard of the people for them increased;
stringent opposition, promoted by
sectarian dissensions, died out, and mission
stations, with numerous churches, some of
considerable importance and promise, were
established, especially in Armenia. The
principal cause of the encouragement they
met with was the wise policy, lately adopted,
of promoting missionary work by education.</p>

<p>The extensive body of Protestant missionaries
now found in Turkey is almost entirely
American. The meetings of the Board are
held in Constantinople; it controls the administration
of the different missions and directs
the large American College at Bebek—the
best foreign institute for education in the
country.</p>

<p>When a community of Protestant converts
numbers a few families it is given a church
and school, and one of the principal men is
elected as chief of the society. This person
is presented officially to the authorities by
one of the consuls of the protecting powers—generally
the English; he is recognized as
chief of his community, obtains a seat in the
local court, and is intrusted with all the interests
of his co-religionists. In difficult or
complicated cases the missionaries themselves
share the responsibilities of this chief, and
through consular or ambassadorial agency
generally settle all matters calling for redress
and justice in a satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The few English missionaries who are established
in Turkey are intrusted with the
fruitless task of endeavoring to convert the
Jews.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic missionaries, from
the date of the separation of the Eastern and
Western Churches, have ever been actively
and diligently employed in making converts.
Thus a great portion of the population of
Syria, yielding to their influence, has become
Roman Catholic, as have the Bosnians, a
portion of the Albanians, some of the Greeks
inhabiting the islands, the Armenians of Constantinople,
and of later years a small portion
of the Bulgarians. The action of the missionaries
of late years has not, however, been
so much directed towards making new converts
as it has to consolidating and strengthening
the tie binding the few scattered communities
to the mother-church. This religious
body recruits itself chiefly from France
and Italy, and consists of priests, monks, and
Sisters of Charity, belonging chiefly to the orders
of St. Benois, the Jesuits, Lazarists, and
St. Vincent de Paul. Their extensive establishments
are situated in the Frank quarters
of the towns, and consist of well-built and
spacious churches, monasteries, schools,
orphan asylums, and foundling hospitals.
Pera and Galata contain a goodly number of
these establishments, as do the principal
towns of European and Asiatic Turkey.
These missions are evidently well furnished
with funds, for their establishments have
everywhere a prosperous appearance, and
are provided with every requisite for the purposes
for which they are intended. The religious
instruction given in them is, however,
extremely illiberal, bigoted, and imparted
on Jesuitical principles. Exclusiveness
and intolerance towards other creeds are
openly prescribed. “Point de salut hors de
l’Eglise” is their doctrine. Considerable
laxity is allowed in moral points so long as
they do not interfere with the external duties
of the community to the church. Should an
individual belonging to another creed die
among the community, the rite of burial will
be refused to him by the Roman Catholic
priests, but those of the Orthodox Church
will often in that case consent to perform it.
Even the marriage ceremony, unless performed
in their churches, is considered by
the more bigoted portion of the Roman Catholic
clergy as not binding. This strange
statement was made in my presence before a
large gathering of persons belonging to different
creeds, by the superior of a Lazarist
establishment at A⸺. It was on the occasion
of the marriage of two members of the
Latin community of that town, when the service
was terminated by the following short
address to the married couple: “Twice
happy are you to belong to the Holy Church
of Rome and to be united in the sacred ties
of matrimony within her bosom: for in the
same manner as there is no hope after life
for those who do not belong to her, so marriage
is not binding out of her, but every
woman who so gives herself is not a legal
wife but a concubine!” In many cases the
sacrament is refused to ladies united in marriage
to persons belonging to other creeds.</p>

<p>The secular teaching given in the schools
of these missions is limited, and, based on the
same principles as the religion, is illiberal and
narrow-minded. Much time is consecrated
by the pupils to religious recitations, prayers,
and penances of no possible profit to the
children. Thus from an early age, imbued
with narrow ideas and made to lose sight of
the spirit of Christianity, the Roman Catholic
communities, be they of European, Greek,
or Armenian nationality, are the most bigoted,
intolerant, and exclusive of all the Christian
communities of the East.</p>

<p>The missionaries belonging to this Church
are unsurpassed in the admirable manner in
which their charitable establishments are arranged.
The homes and asylums for the
poor and orphan children are for the girls
under the control of the Sisters of Charity,
and for the boys under that of the priests and
monks. These are well kept, and very orderly,
the food is good and abundant, and
the dress of the children solid and befitting
their condition. Hospitals are attached to
each establishment, where the sick are well
cared for and destitute Europeans admitted
irrespective of creed. The good Sisters of
Charity take upon themselves the duty of
watching over the patients night and day.
A dispensary is included in each mission station,
where medicines and medical advice are
given gratuitously. The children reared in
these establishments are placed in situations
on leaving them; but I regret to be obliged
to say that comparatively few of either sex
are known to turn out honest and respectable.</p>

<p>The retired lives led by these active servants
of Rome do not prevent their being
very intimately connected with their respective
communities or using their all-powerful
influence for good or for evil in all family
concerns. They are hardy, active, and most
persevering; their personal wants are small
and their mode of living modest and unassuming.
But in spite of this they are worldly-wise,
crafty, and unscrupulous as to the
means they use in obtaining their ends.
Their mode of action is based upon the principle
that the end justifies the means; few,
therefore, are the scruples that will arrest
their action or the dangers and difficulties
that will damp their courage or check their
ardor in their work.</p>

<p>All the internal regulations and arrangements
of the Catholic community are made
without the Porte troubling itself much
about them—indeed, to do the Turk justice,
in his high contempt for things Christian, he
keeps as much as possible out of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
dissensions of his subjects, and when by
chance he does appear on the scene of action,
by turns persecutor, protector, or peacemaker,
he is generally prompted in the matter
by one of the interested parties. An
amusing incident witnessed by one of my
friends at Jerusalem well illustrates this fact.
This gentleman accompanied one of the
peacemaking governors-general to the Holy
City at the time the quarrel of the possession
of the little door leading to the Sepulchre
was at its highest. All the interested parties
loaded the Pasha with acts of politeness and
civility, which he received with great urbanity;
but when the great question was delicately
broached in the course of conversation, he
at once turned round and exclaimed, Turkish
fashion, “Oh, my soul! I pray do not open
that door to me!”</p>

<p>There is little to be said about the Uniates,
or Bulgarian Catholic converts in Turkey.
The movement in its commencement, effects,
and results may be compared to Midhat
Pasha’s Constitution—a farce and imposition
from beginning to end. Like the Constitution,
the Uniate movement broke out in the
midst of a hot fever of excitement and discontent;
the first was created as a palliative
for Turkish misrule, the second emanated
from the mismanagement of a church. The
disputes between the Greeks and Bulgarians
on the church question was at its height
when a certain number of Bulgarians, carried
away by the hope of ameliorating the actual
condition of things and ultimately obtaining
their end, viz., the emancipation of the Bulgarian
Church from the Greek, accepted the
nominal supremacy of the Romish Church,
and by a fictitious conversion became attached
to it under the denomination of Uniates.
Their number, at first small, would
probably have remained so had it not been
that some effective arguments and causes
gave it a momentary impetus, bringing it
under public notice. The sensational part of
the incident was due to the exaggerated accounts
given by the agents of the Propaganda
and other societies of the future triumphs
of Rome in this new field of action, and to
the political advantage which the government
of Napoleon III. tried to derive from it.
Monsieur Bouré, the ambassador at that time
in Turkey, greatly favored the movement,
while some of the consular agents, overstepping
their instructions, held out to the Bulgarian
people the open support and protection
of the French Government in favor of
the anticipated converts: “C’est ici,” said
one of those zealous agents, “C’est ici au
consulat de France que la nation Bulgare doit
dorénavant tourner son regard, porter ses
plaintes et demander protection!”</p>

<p>The most telling argument with the Bulgarian
peasant to abjure his faith was not the
future benefit his soul would derive from
the change nor the value of French influence
and protection, but simply the prospect of
freeing himself from all future Church impositions,
and having his children educated
at the schools of the Propaganda free of
cost. These conditions were very enticing,
and some thousands, yielding to the further
influence of a few of their superiors who had
declared themselves Uniates, blindly followed
these as sheep following their shepherd
in search of food. They knew nothing
of the dogmatic side of the question, and
cared not to inquire. The name of the Pope
was substituted for that of the Patriarch of
Constantinople; the ignorant Greek or Bulgarian
priests were superseded by Polish
preachers well versed in the Bulgarian
tongue, whose sermons were composed with
a view to impressing the people with a sense
of the material rather than the spiritual benefits
to be derived from their apostasy. The
proselytizing centres were Adrianople, Monastir,
and Salonika, where large establishments
belonging to the Roman Catholic Societies
undertook the work of conversion in a
very zealous manner, and established branches
in places of smaller importance in order to
give more weight to the affair and increase
the confidence of the Bulgarians in its stability.
A Bulgarian monk, the best that could
be got, was pounced upon by the Fathers and
sent to Rome to be consecrated primate of
the Uniates. This individual, unprepossessing
in appearance and utterly ignorant and
stupid, remained at Rome in order to receive
the homage due to him as the future primate
of the Uniates, and then returned to Bulgaria,
where every effort was made by the agents
of the Propaganda to give importance to the
event and establish the authority of the new
primate. The poor Bulgarian Uniates, closely
watched and pressed on both sides by the
Greeks and the Bulgarians, found it very
hard to stand their ground. They began to
show signs of laxity of zeal, and gradually
dropped out of the newly-formed flock. This
reaction took a very decided turn after the
formation of the Bulgarian national church,
when the converts <i>en bloc</i> returned to it, leaving
a few of the faithful to occupy the
benches of the deserted churches, and some
orphans and beggars to people the schools attached
to them.</p>

<p>Thus began and ended an affair which was
nothing but a joke to those who were on the
spot and behind the scenes; while the Catholic
world, judging from all the wild tales of
the press on the subject, seemed to lose their
reason over it to the extent of exciting the
curiosity of some governments and greatly
alarming others, until the thing died out, to
make room for more important matters.</p>

<p>However successful the work of conversion
may be in the East when it is carried on
(as with the Romish Church) with the object
of entirely denationalizing a community and
absorbing it into the proselytizing church, it
will prove a failure in the long run. In the
case of the United or Catholic Armenians,
one sees another instance of the tendency of
all the subject races of the Porte whenever a
question of religion or political liberty is
raised; it is to the West that one and all
look for the settlement of these questions, for
support, and for protection. European interference
has been systematically imposed
upon the Porte, and has obtained ascendancy
over it in proportion as the Turk has become
weak and incapable of resistance.</p>

<p>The Armenian nation seems to have remained
united and at peace with the Church
of its adoption until the year 1587, when
Pope Sixtus sent the Bishop of Sidon as ambassador
to the Armenian Melkhites, Jacobites,
and Chaldean communities, to recover
them from their heresy and establish papal
authority over them; but the utmost the
legate obtained at the time was the consent
of the Armenian Patriarch of Cilicia to sign
a confession of the Catholic faith according to
the statutes of the Council of Florence. In
the meanwhile numerous missionaries belonging
to the order of the Jesuits and others
had settled in the country with the object of
carrying on the work of conversion. It was
one of these, a Jesuit, who, a century later,
converted Mechitar, the illustrious founder
of the United Armenian community, which
now numbers over 40,000 souls. Mechitar
united in his person the qualities of the theologian,
the scholar, and the patriot. Yielding
to persuasion, he adopted the Catholic
creed and directed all his energies to propagating
it among his countrymen. His ideas
were, however, those of an enlightened man
who wished to combine conversion with
mental development and liberal ideas based
upon the sound foundation of separating the
civil from the religious rights, founding a
Church, Catholic in faith, but Armenian in
nationality, with a constitution free from the
direct control and interference of the See of
Rome. It is impossible to say how far the
project of the intrepid convert was feasible;
his enterprise met with very decided opposition
from the head of the propaganda,
whose efforts were directed with fanatical
tenacity and ardor towards denationalizing
and Latinizing the new converts. Thus the
community in its very origin found itself divided
into two branches—the liberal, professing
the views of Mechitar, proud of the name
of Armenian, and desirous of promoting the
interests of their fatherland; and the Ultramontanes,
bigoted and holding Rome as the
sole pivot on which their social, moral, and
religious existence turned. These divisions
soon caused dissensions, and Mechitar, finding
the opposition of the Fathers too strong
for him in his native land, left it and went to
Constantinople, where he hoped to find more
liberty and a more extended field for action.
Here, also, bitter disappointment awaited
him, for he found the pressure of the European
Fathers put upon the new Church;
mild persuasion and exhortation were set
aside and an earnest policy of intolerance and
exclusiveness was preached to the new community,
forbidding its members to enter the
churches of their fathers, which were represented
as “sanctuaries of the devil,” holding
its liturgy up to execration, and refusing absolution
to those unwilling to submit to these
severe doctrines. This system of intolerance
succeeded so well with the retrograde party
as to widen the breach already separating it
from the liberal, and sowed at the same time
the seeds of that mortal hatred between the
United and the Gregorian Armenians that
has more than once well-nigh caused their
common destruction. At this stage, while
party dissensions rendered union among the
Armenian Catholics impossible, the work of
proselytism marched on, until the Gregorians,
alarmed at its rapid progress, rose in a
body, and by means of hypocrisy and intrigue,
headed by their uncompromising
patriarch Ephraim, obtained a firman from
the Porte ordering the banishment of all the
Armenian Catholics from Constantinople.
Thus the sparks of persecution kindled by
this patriarch soon spread into a general conflagration
under his successor Avidic, who,
gaining the ear and support of the Grand
Mufti Feizallah, obtained decree after decree
for the persecution, confiscation, and expatriation
of all their opponents in the empire,
including the Fathers. The blow was too
strong, and the sensation it created too great,
for it to be passed over by the Western powers
belonging to the same Church. A French
ambassador consequently raised his voice so
loudly and effectively at the Porte as to have
the obnoxious patriarch expelled and exiled
to Chios; the ill-fated dignitary, however,
was not allowed to expiate his evil-doing
in peace and solitude, but, waylaid, it is believed,
by some equally unchristian Jesuit
Fathers, he was kidnapped and taken to the
Isle of St. Margaret, where he died the death
of a martyr.</p>

<p>The Porte, in its desire to right the wronged,
felt ill-requited by this act. The abduction
of the Patriarch, together with other grievances,
magnified by the Gregorians, increased
its discontent, and, casting its mask of reconciliation
aside, it became the open and direct
persecutor of the suspected community.
The Jesuits’ house at Galata was put under
surveillance, the Armenian printing establishment
was closed, and proselytism was
forbidden on pain of exile. A Hatti ordered
the arrest of all the Armenian adherents of
the Romish Church. What remained of the
community continued in hiding, awaiting a
favorable time for its reappearance. Mechitar
himself, suspected, distrusted, and disliked
by all parties save his own, fled from
Constantinople, and, after many vicissitudes
and an unsuccessful attempt to found a monastery
at Medon, finally succeeded in doing
so in the Isle of St. Lazarus, granted to him
by the republic of Venice. The monastery
he there founded was of the order of St. Benedict,
and was later on approved of by a bull
of Clement XI. In this quiet refuge the
learned monk established his order, which
took the name of Mechitarists after him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
has become the college, not of orthodox
catholicism, as understood and practised by
the Latinized converts, but of learning, patriotism,
and liberal views and ideas in religious
matters. Scarcely had the United Armenians
recovered from the shock of this
persecution than they were again, in 1759,
subjected to a fresh one set on foot as before
by the Gregorians, who forced upon them
religious forms repulsive to them, backed by
the active support of the Porte. But the
most critical moment for the very existence
of the community, including a considerable
proportion of Franks, was the time of the
battle of Navarino. All the ill-humor and
exasperation of the Turks fell upon the unfortunate
Armenian Catholics, who, represented
to the credulous Turks as traitors and
spies of the Franks, were treated accordingly,
and persecution and exile, ruin and
death, were once more their lot. The principal
actors in this last were an obscure
sheikh who had a tekké at Stamboul, and
who by some freak of fortune had risen to
the rank of Kadi Asker, becoming far famed
as Khalet Effendi, and an individual who
was pipe-bearer in the Duz-Oglou family,
one of the wealthiest of the United Armenian
families.</p>

<p>The Porte declared that it recognized only
one Armenian nation and one Armenian religion,
and invited all schismatics to abjure
their apostasy and return to the bosom of
their own church and nation, on which conditions
they could alone be pardoned. This
was the climax of the evils and sufferings of
the United Armenians. The Governments
of Western Europe, indignant at this rigorous
treatment and the miseries it brought
upon an unfortunate community, took up its
cause, and after a prolonged dispute between
the French Government and the Porte, the
determined conduct of the representative of
the former power triumphed over the intrigues
of the Gregorian Armenians and the
ill-will and cruelty of the Porte; the exiles
were recalled, their property restored, and
they were recognized as a separate community
under a patriarch of their own. We
need not follow all the difficulties and complications
that had to be overcome before these
salutary results could be obtained. Since that
epoch this community was formed into a
separate body, and owing its welfare, security,
and subsequent prosperity to the protection
of France has enjoyed in peace the
same rights and privileges as the Gregorians.
These privileges were further granted by the
Porte under the same pressure to the other
Catholic communities. The grant of these
concessions constituted France the moral
supporter and religious protector of all the
Catholics of the East, and for some years
French influence in favor of the Catholic rayahs
was supreme at the Porte.</p>

<p>In 1831 the community began once more to
consolidate itself by the scattered members
returning to their homes and re-assuming the
ordinary business of life. Much had been done
in their favor, but much remained to be done
by the community itself. The first step was
to frame a general assembly, composed of
representatives of the various classes of the
community by whom the national interests
were discussed and debated upon with much
freedom. The result was the election of a
president who was confirmed by the Porte,
and invested with temporal authority alone.
The spiritual power was conferred on a primate
appointed by the Pope. This measure
was adopted in the hope of preventing one
authority from encroaching upon the other;
the patriarch’s seal was divided into three
parts, which were intrusted respectively to
the patriarch, the primate, and the president
of the council. Other measures were also
adopted which established the interests and
influence of the Church on a solid basis, increased
the privileges of the community at
large, and greatly heightened its prestige.
But dissensions and jealousies crept in, destroyed
the passing dignity of the Church,
and brought it to the low level of its adherents,
making it a centre of bigotry and intolerance
on one side and of struggling efforts
for enlightenment and emancipation on the
other.</p>

<p>Mechitar’s views and principles are held in
increasing veneration by the liberal and progressive
Armenians, who believe that the
future prosperity of their country is dependent
on them. Imbued with these ideas, it is
not astonishing to find that this party and
that of the Propaganda and Latinized Armenians
are in a state of continual contention,
undermining the peace and prospects of the
community.</p>

<p>In 1846, Father Minassian, a Mechitarist
monk, proposed the establishment of a society
for the reconciliation of the two divisions
of the nation with the view of the furthering
education and ultimate political emancipation
of the Armenians. The Conservative party,
with the patriarch at its head, rejected his
plan, which, warmly taken up by the Liberal
(or as it is now called Anti-Hassounist) party
led to fresh disputes and dissensions, keeping
this community for years in a continual
state of religious agitation and setting families
at variance. The Anti-Hassounist party
comprises some of the most wealthy and influential
families, while the Hassounists, on
the other hand, boast of the influence of their
patriarch, the approval and protection of
Rome, and the assistance and co-operation of
the Propaganda; accordingly, of late years,
both parties have sallied forth from their former
reserved attitude and offered to the
world of Constantinople the spectacle of a
pitched battle—one side armed with all the
power that spiritual help can afford, the other
bracing itself with the force of argument and
the protection and favor of the Porte.</p>

<p>Hassoun and his party accepted the doctrine
of the Infallibility of the Pope, and committed
their spiritual welfare and worldly concerns
into the keeping of the mother Church, trusting
to her maternal care for unlimited patronage.
The Anti-Hassounists, led by Kupelian,
rebelled against this despotic arrangement,
denied the Infallibility and the right of the
Church of Rome to interfere in the social
and religious organization of the community;
they actually went so far as to break out
into open rebellion, and, supported and protected
by Hossein Aoni Pasha and some of
his colleagues, denied the authority of the
patriarch, drove his adherents out of the
schools, closed the churches, and sent away
the priests under his control, finally effecting
the schism which lies under Papal excommunication,
but prospers nevertheless,
and must ultimately, as the nation advances,
triumph over opposition and attain equality,
independent of the powerful and absorbing
influence of the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The spiritual authority of this new sect is
in the keeping of a patriarch whose election
by the community is confirmed by the Porte.
He enjoys the same rights and privileges as
the patriarchs of the other communities.
The patriarch of the United Armenians receives
a stipend of 5000 piastres per month,
exclusive of the salaries of the officers of
his chancery. The expenses of the <i>bairat</i>,
amounting to 500 piastres, are defrayed by
the community and furnished by a proportionate
tax levied by the National Council.
The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy consists of the
Patriarchs of Cilicia, the Primate of Constantinople,
the bishops, and the monastic
and secular clergy. The principal see is
solely supported by funds provided by the
Propaganda of Rome and the “œuvres des
missions.”</p>

<p>The priests are divided into <i>Vartabieds</i>, or
doctors, and <i>derders</i>, or ordinary priests.
Some of the former may be found at the
head of small churches, aided by derders
or acolytes. They occupy a modest position
in rich families, where they are employed
as religious instructors of youth and
general counsellors of the family. As a
class, however, their voice in the Church is
overruled by that of the clergy of the Propaganda.
The Vartabieds carry a crosier; no
regular stipend is allotted to them, but they
derive their support from church fees. The
regular clergy consists of Mechitarist and
Antonine monks, who have colleges at Venice,
Constantinople, and Mount Lebanon.</p>

<p>The national council of the United Armenians
is composed of twelve lay members
called Bairatlis; their election is confirmed
by the Porte. They are unpaid, and their
period of office is limited to two years, six
retiring and six resuming office annually.
This council works in conjunction with
the Patriarch; it regulates all matters concerning
the civil and financial affairs of the
community; it is the arbitrator and judge of
all disputes among the United Armenians.
This community at Constantinople alone
numbers about 20,000 souls, forming seven
parishes in different parts of the city.</p>

<p>In Pera, annexed to the church of St.
John Chrysostom, they possess an infirmary
for the poor and a lunatic asylum; each
parish has a primary school, and some institutes
for female education exists. One of
these, founded in 1850 by the family of
Duz-Oglou, is conducted by a French lady
and placed under French control; the instruction
afforded is in the French and Armenian
languages.</p>

<p>The unfortunate duality ever present in
the Church makes itself felt in the educational
department as well, and greatly impedes
its progress. The Mechitarist Fathers
of St. Lazarus include in the religious and
literary instruction given in their schools the
records of past Armenian glory, inculcate a
love of country, teach its language, and render
its illustrious authors familiar to the rising
generation; the current language in
their institution is the Armenian. The opposition
abuse and ridicule all that is Armenian,
and replace the native language by
Latin and Italian, or French; their principle
is, “Let nationality perish rather than
doctrine, the holy pulpit was never established
to teach patriotism, but gospel truth.”
The tutelar saints of the Armenians, treated
with the same disrespect, are replaced by
saints from the Roman calendar.</p>

<p>In character and disposition the United
Armenians are peaceable, regular in their
habits, industrious, and fond of amassing
wealth; parsimonious and even miserly in
their ideas, the love of ostentation and
good-feeding has yet a powerful effect upon
their purse-strings. They are, however, considerably
in advance of the Gregorian Armenians.
The youth of the better classes are
for the most part conversant with European
languages and the external forms of good society,
affect European manners, and profess
liberal views. Owing to the higher educational
privileges they enjoy, they have made
more progress in the arts and professions than
the Gregorian Armenians. The school of
Mechitar has produced scholars of considerable
merit, but the vocation they seem specially
made for is that of banking. In all careers
their success has been signal. There
was a time when the increasing wealth and
prosperity of the United Armenians was the
cause of much envy and jealousy, when no
European banking houses existed in Turkey,
and the financial affairs of the Ottomans were
left entirely in the hands of the Armenian
bankers, who directed the mint and regulated
the finances of the government and of the
Pashas. On the change of system, the ruin
of the State as well as that of most of these
families, once so wealthy, became inevitable.
Should Armenia, however, eventually become
a principality, should the Mechitarist
school triumph over sectarian susceptibilities,
and an understanding be arrived at leading to
a national union between the United and the
Gregorian Armenians, a considerable number
of wealthy, intelligent, and earnest men, fit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
to be placed at the head of a nation, and able
to control it with wisdom, prudence, and
moderation, will not be wanting in both
branches of this widely scattered nation.
The critical moment in the destinies of this
country has, I believe, arrived. The Armenians,
detesting the Ottoman rule, are ready
to cast themselves into the arms of any
power that will offer them protection and
guarantee their future emancipation. The
turning-point reached, Russia or England
will have to face them and listen to their
claims. If their cause is taken up in good
time they will be saved; and the name and
prestige of England, already pretty widely
spread in Armenia, will become all-powerful.</p>
